0. Agent‑set architecture (the control room for your divorce)

Design your helper set as 8–10 specialized “agents,” each with a clear mandate, inputs/outputs, and guardrails. You can run them manually (checklists + templates) or wire them into software.

Core agents

Safety & Crisis Agent

Purpose: Identify and mitigate risk (domestic violence, stalking, coercive control, relocation risks).

Outputs: Safety plan; hotline contacts; protective‑order options; discreet comms plan; “do not do” list.

Guardrails: Never advise illegal surveillance, recording, or tracking. Refer to domestic‑violence resources for safety planning and confidential support.

Legal Navigator Agent

Purpose: Map process (filing → service → temporary orders → disclosures/discovery → mediation/settlement → trial → decree → post‑decree).

Guardrails: Jurisdiction switch—when you enter a location, it loads local rules/forms and shows jurisdiction‑specific cautions (e.g., “automatic temporary restraining orders” in California).
DivorceNet

Document & Evidence Agent

Purpose: Intake, index, and preserve: financials, messages, kids’ records, photos.

Guardrails: Legal preservation (no deletion/spoliation), lawful evidence gathering (no hacking/wiretaps), recording rules by state.
Reporters Committee

Financial Forensics & Budget Agent

Purpose: Inventory assets/debts; characterize (marital vs separate); spot dissipation; build budgets; surface support/fee scenarios.

Guardrails: Flag QDRO‑required plans; don’t advise asset concealment; push mandatory disclosures checklists.
DOL

Co‑Parenting & Child‑Focus Agent

Purpose: Draft parenting plans; align with “best interests of the child”; manage calendars, exchanges, and school/medical coordination; UCCJEA checks for multi‑state issues.

Guardrails: De‑escalation norms; no coaching children about litigation; GAL/parenting‑coordinator options for high conflict.
Child Welfare Information Gateway

Negotiation & Settlement Agent

Purpose: Organize proposals, packages, BATNA/WATNA, and guardrail offers; suggest mediation/collaborative structures when appropriate.

Court & Compliance Agent

Purpose: Timeline of deadlines, temporary orders, compliance checks; docket reminders; post‑judgment tasks (title changes, QDRO filings).

Guardrails: ATRO/temporary‑orders alerts where applicable.

Tax & Benefits Agent

Purpose: Filing status, dependency claims, alimony tax treatment (post‑2018 rule), COBRA continuation, beneficiary updates.

Well‑Being & Logistics Agent (optional but helpful)

Purpose: Therapist/support group referrals, routines for kids, housing/insurance checklists, credit hygiene.

Data model & governance (brief)

Vault: encrypted store for IDs, finances, kids’ records.

Timeline: dated log of events, orders, and communications.

Red flags: violence, relocation, asset flight, coercive control, substance abuse—route to Safety & Legal.

Legal guardrails: no illegal access/recording; no evidence spoliation; no advice to hide funds; respect court orders.

1. A–Z roadmap of the divorce process
   A. Immediate safety & stabilization (Day 0–7)

Draft a safety plan (home, work, school, digital, finances). Store a go‑bag for you/the kids (IDs, meds, proofs, backups).

Consider protective orders if there’s violence/coercion; get confidential safety planning support.

Digital hygiene: change passwords, enable 2FA, review account recovery emails/phones. (Do not access your spouse’s devices or accounts without permission—risk of criminal liability under federal/state laws.)

B. Choose your resolution track

Mediation (neutral facilitator; you keep control; often faster/cheaper). See 2025 AFCC/ABA Model Standards for good‑practice baselines.

Collaborative divorce (two lawyers + neutral financial/child specialists; no court filings during the process).

Litigation (court‑driven; necessary for emergencies/high conflict or when disclosure/cooperation fails).
Your agent set can recommend a track after a short intake about conflict level, safety, and asset complexity.

C. Pre‑filing prep (Week 1–3)

Document sweep (12–36 months): pay stubs, tax returns, bank/credit/crypto, retirement/stock, titles, insurance, mortgages/leases, business books, frequent‑flier points, school/health records.

Credit & identity: pull reports, consider fraud alert or freeze if risk.

Budget: current + post‑separation.

Process map: venue, grounds, and service strategy. (If you’re in a place like California, know that Automatic Temporary Restraining Orders (ATROs) may instantly limit asset moves and child relocations upon filing/serving.)

D. Filing & service

File a petition/complaint and serve the other party. Temporary restraints may take effect (varies by jurisdiction).
DivorceNet

If domestic violence is present, seek temporary custody/support and exclusive use orders as needed.

E. Temporary orders (first 30–90 days)

Typical issues: temporary parenting schedule, exclusive use of home/vehicle, temporary child support/spousal support, status‑quo financial orders.

Follow all orders precisely; violations damage credibility.

F. Financial disclosures & discovery

Expect mandatory financial disclosures (financial affidavit + documents) within set timeframes; failure or dishonesty can trigger sanctions.

Do not hide assets or destroy records—courts may impose fines, fee‑shifts, adverse findings, even contempt.

Evidence preservation: don’t delete texts/social posts—spoliation can lead to adverse inferences/sanctions.

G. Parenting plan & “best interests of the child”

Courts focus on best interests (continuity, stability, caregiving history, safety, health, schooling, child’s needs/voice by age, and DV). Draft a plan around the child’s routine and developmental needs.
Child Welfare Information Gateway

Multi‑state issues use the UCCJEA to decide which court has custody jurisdiction.
NCJFCJ

For persistent high conflict, consider a guardian ad litem (GAL) or parenting coordinator to keep decisions child‑focused and reduce court trips.

H. Property division (classify → value → divide)

Characterize: marital/community vs separate property; most places use equitable distribution (fair ≠ always 50/50), while some use community property regimes.
Legal Information Institute
+1

Value: home, vehicles, businesses, RSUs/options, retirement, crypto, points/miles.

Retirement (401(k)/pension): many plans require a QDRO to divide; a decree alone isn’t enough for ERISA plans.
DOL

Debts: classify and apportion with tax/credit impacts noted.

I. Support (child & spousal)

Child support: set by state guidelines—income, parenting time, healthcare/childcare costs, etc. (Federal role is oversight; states apply their own formulas.)
Congress.gov

Spousal support (alimony/maintenance): factors often include length of marriage, incomes/earning capacity, health/age, standard of living, caregiving impacts, and more (example: CA Fam. Code §4320).

Tax: In the U.S., for agreements executed after 2018, alimony is not deductible by the payer and not taxable to the recipient.

J. Settlement (mediation/collaborative) or trial

Package proposals (property + support + parenting) rather than haggling item‑by‑item.

If settling, craft a Marital Settlement Agreement (MSA) + Parenting Plan with precise terms and enforcement language.

If trying the case, your agent set should generate: witness lists, exhibit lists, timelines, demonstratives, and “facts & law” outlines tied to the best‑interest and property/support standards.

K. Judgment & post‑decree tasks

Record and retitle assets; file QDROs; update beneficiaries/POAs, close joint credit, and re‑paper insurance.

Health insurance: ex‑spouses often can elect COBRA continuation (commonly up to 36 months after divorce) but must notify on time and pay the full premium.

Taxes: confirm filing status (as of Dec. 31), dependency claims, and post‑divorce W‑4 updates (IRS Pub. 504).

2. Strategies to protect yourself and the kids
   Safety, privacy, and lawful evidence

No illegal spying: installing spyware, guessing passwords, or intercepting emails/calls can violate federal and state laws (Wiretap Act/ECPA and CFAA). Gather evidence lawfully; talk to counsel about preserving texts/social posts.

Recording: call/meeting recordings are state‑specific (one‑party vs all‑party consent). When in doubt, get consent or don’t record.
Reporters Committee

Do not delete potential evidence; courts can penalize spoliation of electronic information.

Finances & credit

Inventory and monitor accounts; set alerts; pull official credit reports; consider fraud alerts/credit freezes if appropriate.

Respect temporary restraining/ATRO‑style orders—often they bar changing insurance beneficiaries, moving kids out of state, or major asset moves until the court says otherwise (example: California Fam. Code §2040).

Co‑parenting in the child’s best interests

Keep exchanges predictable, child‑centered routines, neutral language, and school/medical coordination transparent.

If there’s high conflict, ask your court (or your lawyer) about appointing a GAL or parenting coordinator.

Interstate issues: the UCCJEA controls which court can decide custody and enforces out‑of‑state orders.
NCJFCJ

3. “Things the other person might do” (and how to counter them legally)

Hide or dissipate assets (transfers to friends, undervaluing, crypto shuffles, cash withdrawals).

Counter: fast disclosures; subpoenas; bank/crypto statements; forensic accounting; request sanctions/fee‑shifts for concealment.

Financial control during separation (closing joint cards, removing you from insurance).

Counter: temporary support orders; ATRO‑style protections; insurance orders; COBRA election if coverage stops.

Litigation abuse (frivolous motions, serial filings to harass or drain resources), common in coercive‑control dynamics.

Counter: seek protective orders, consolidation, attorney’s fees, and court‑recognized remedies against abusive litigation where available.

Gatekeeping the kids (denying time, last‑minute schedule changes, unilateral school/doctor moves).

Counter: temporary parenting orders; GAL/parenting coordinator; detailed parenting plan with notice/decision rules.

Illicit surveillance (keyloggers, “Find My” trackers, password guessing).

Counter: device checks, account audits, strong passwords/2FA; document suspicion; do not retaliate in kind (CFAA/ECPA risk).

Social‑media warfare (provocations or bait to elicit bad responses).

Counter: post nothing; preserve evidence; communicate in a brief, factual style; no deletions (avoid spoliation).

4. What’s allowed vs. not allowed (typical boundaries)

Generally allowed (confirm locally):

Opening an individual bank account and tracking your income/expenses (do not transfer joint funds in violation of court orders or ATRO‑like restraints).

Recording conversations in many jurisdictions only if you are a party and your state permits one‑party consent. ✔️ Verify first.
Reporters Committee

Gathering your own records and copies of joint statements you lawfully have access to.

Generally not allowed:

Hacking or unauthorized access to a spouse’s phone/computer/accounts (CFAA), or intercepting communications (Wiretap Act/ECPA). ❌

Deleting potentially relevant ESI (texts, posts) after litigation is reasonably anticipated (spoliation sanctions). ❌

Violating ATRO‑style restraints (e.g., changing insurance beneficiaries, relocating children) once in effect. ❌

5. How to divide things fairly (property, debt, benefits)

Make the master inventory

Bucket A: separate (pre‑marriage, gifts/inheritances, post‑separation—varies).

Bucket B: marital/community (acquired during marriage).

Flag commingled assets for tracing. Most U.S. jurisdictions follow equitable distribution (fairness factors), while a minority follow community property rules.
Legal Information Institute
+1

Value correctly

Home (comparables or appraisal), retirement (get plan documents), business interests (neutral valuation), equity awards/RSUs (vesting schedules), crypto, points/miles.

Allocate and equalize

Aim for in‑kind splits first (each keeps certain assets) + an equalization payment.

Retirement plans covered by ERISA typically require a QDRO; build that into the decree and calendar the filing with the plan.
DOL

Debt

Tie debt to the asset where possible (e.g., HELOC to the home). Include indemnification clauses and payoff deadlines.

Tax and benefits

Alimony tax treatment depends on agreement date (post‑2018 ≠ deductible/includable). Child support is not income to the recipient. Use IRS Pub 504 for filing status/credits and plan COBRA if you’ll lose coverage.

6. Kids: “best interests” and durable parenting plans

Principles that tend to matter

Stability/continuity, each parent’s caregiving history, ability to meet the child’s needs, mental/physical health, safe home, school ties, and—age‑appropriately—the child’s voice. Domestic violence weighs heavily.
Child Welfare Information Gateway

Plan elements

Regular schedule, holidays/vacations rotation, exchanges/logistics, decision‑making (education/medical/activities), travel/relocation notice, tech/communication norms, dispute‑resolution method (e.g., parenting coordinator).

Multi‑state

Confirm jurisdiction and enforcement under UCCJEA before filing or relocating.
NCJFCJ

When conflict is chronic

Request a GAL to represent the child’s best interests; consider a parenting coordinator to resolve day‑to‑day disputes under court appointment.

7. Playbooks & checklists (ready to run)
   Core checklists (quick‑start)

Safety & Crisis: hotline numbers; code words with friends/kids; safe devices & accounts; emergency cash; safe exchange locations.

Documents: IDs; tax returns (3 years); pay stubs; bank/credit/loan/crypto; retirement & plan SPD; deeds/titles; insurance (life/health/auto/home); school/medical records; childcare invoices.

Court & Compliance: calendar all deadlines; temporary orders; discovery due dates; mediation date; trial readiness; post‑decree filings (QDRO, titles, beneficiaries).

Credit & Identity: pull reports from the official site; consider fraud alert/freeze if you detect misuse.

Health Coverage: COBRA notice (often 60‑day window), marketplace quotes, employer plan options.

Communication norms (to reduce risk and help your case)

Keep messages Brief, Informative, Neutral, and Firm.

Assume a judge might read anything you write.

Avoid child‑related scheduling via verbal only—use a written channel (texts/email) you can later produce.

8. Settlement strategies that work

Package proposals: Trade across issues (e.g., equity in the home vs. retirement split vs. support duration) rather than fighting line‑by‑line.

Use objective anchors: appraisals, guideline child support, vocational assessments.

Mediation/collaborative: bring principled options that meet both parties’ core interests; start with uncontested items to build momentum.

9. What to never do in a divorce (common, costly mistakes)

Hide or move assets, lie on affidavits, or “forget” accounts—sanctions and credibility damage are worse than the short‑term gain.

Intercept or hack your spouse’s communications; plant trackers/spyware; or record in an all‑party consent state without consent.
Reporters Committee

Delete texts/social posts once litigation is in play—preserve them; ask counsel before any cleanup.

Violate ATRO/temporary orders (e.g., moving kids, changing insurance beneficiaries) once they apply.

10. “First 10 moves” you can take today

If safety is an issue, create a personal safety plan and line up confidential help.

Change passwords and enable 2FA on personal accounts (email, cloud, banking).

Pull credit reports from the official site; set alerts.

Start the document inventory (see checklist).

Draft a child‑centric weekly schedule that fits school/activities.

Sketch your budget (current and post‑separation).

Identify your resolution track (mediation/collaborative/litigation) based on conflict and complexity.

List top 5 assets and top 5 risks (e.g., business valuations, relocation).

Note any deadlines: disclosures, temporary orders, mediation dates.

Book a consult with a local family lawyer (or court self‑help clinic) to localize the plan.
