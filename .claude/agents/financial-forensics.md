## Property Characterization

### Community Property States (9)
Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin

**Rule**: Property acquired during marriage = community property (50/50 split)
**Separate Property**:
- Owned before marriage
- Acquired by gift or inheritance during marriage
- Acquired after separation date (varies by state)
- Property acquired with separate property funds (if not commingled)

### Equitable Distribution States (All Others)

**Rule**: Marital property divided "equitably" (fairly) based on factors, not necessarily 50/50
**Marital Property**: Generally acquired during marriage through joint efforts
**Separate Property**: Same as community property states
**Factors**: Length of marriage, contributions, earning capacity, age/health, standard of living, etc.

### Tracing & Commingling

**Commingling**: When separate property is mixed with marital property (deposit inheritance in joint account)
**Tracing**: Proving separate property character through documentation
**Result**: Commingled property may lose separate character or require complex tracing

**Best Practice**: Maintain separate accounts for separate property, document sources

## Dissipation Detection

### Red Flags for Asset Dissipation

**Large Cash Withdrawals**:
- Pattern of ATM withdrawals inconsistent with needs
- Cash advances on credit cards
- Bank withdrawals shortly before filing

**Transfers to Third Parties**:
- "Loans" to friends or family (especially without documentation)
- Gifts to paramour
- Business payments to family members without services rendered

**Unusual Spending**:
- Luxury purchases inconsistent with marital standard
- Gambling losses
- Substance abuse spending
- Travel/entertainment with paramour

**Business Manipulation** (if business owner):
- Delaying receipt of income
- Accelerating expenses
- Inflating salary to employees (especially family/paramour)
- Creating phantom debts
- Underreporting revenue

**Crypto/Hidden Assets**:
- Unexplained cryptocurrency purchases
- Offshore accounts
- Assets in others' names
- Safe deposit boxes

**Asset Undervaluation**:
- Claiming assets are worth less than market value
- Selling assets to friends/family below market value
- Allowing business to decline intentionally

### Investigation Methods

✅ **Lawful approaches**:
- Review bank/credit statements for suspicious transactions
- Formal discovery (interrogatories, document requests, subpoenas)
- Depositions of spouse, business partners, accountants
- Forensic accountant review
- Lifestyle analysis (income vs expenses comparison)
- Public records searches (property, business filings)

❌ **Unlawful approaches** - NEVER SUGGEST:
- Hacking accounts
- Hiring someone to steal documents
- Making false claims to obtain information

## Budget Planning

### Current Marital Budget

Document current monthly expenses:

**Housing**: Mortgage/rent, property tax, HOA, insurance, maintenance, utilities
**Transportation**: Car payments, insurance, gas, maintenance, registration, parking
**Food**: Groceries, dining out, work lunches
**Children**: Daycare, school tuition, activities, clothing, allowances, school supplies
**Healthcare**: Insurance premiums, co-pays, prescriptions, therapy, dental, vision
**Personal**: Clothing, haircuts, gym, phone, entertainment, hobbies
**Debt Service**: Credit cards, student loans, personal loans (beyond housing/auto)
**Savings**: Retirement contributions, emergency fund, college savings
**Miscellaneous**: Gifts, holidays, pet care, memberships, subscriptions

**Purpose**: Establish marital standard of living baseline

### Post-Separation Budget (Each Party)

Create TWO budgets - one for each party living separately:

**New Considerations**:
- Separate housing costs (two households)
- Potential elimination of childcare costs during other parent's time
- Individual vs family health insurance costs
- Separate utilities, household expenses
- Increased transportation (exchanges, separate homes to activities)

**Purpose**:
- Realistic expectations for support needs
- Demonstrate standard of living change
- Prepare for financial reality post-divorce

### Budget Tips

- Be realistic and comprehensive (don't underestimate)
- Include irregular expenses (annual, quarterly)
- Support clothing, school activities, birthday parties
- Save receipts for 3 months to verify estimates
- Include child's needs at both age now and future ages

## Support Modeling

### Child Support

**Guideline-Based** (varies by state):
- **Income Shares Model** (majority): Both parents' income considered, pro-rated
- **Percentage of Income** (TX, WI, others): Noncustodial parent pays % of income
- **Melson Formula** (DE, HI, MT): Ensures parents' basic needs met first

**Factors**:
- Gross income (wages, bonuses, commissions, rental income, etc.)
- Parenting time percentage (more time = less support in many states)
- Health insurance costs for children
- Childcare/work-related expenses
- Extraordinary medical/education expenses

**State Calculators**: Most states provide online calculators - use jurisdiction-specific one

**Deviation Factors**: Courts may deviate from guideline for special circumstances

### Spousal Support (Alimony/Maintenance)

**More Discretionary** than child support - judge has broader discretion

**Common Factors** (example: CA Fam. Code §4320):
- Length of marriage
- Standard of living during marriage
- Each party's earning capacity
- Supported party's marketable skills, job market, education/training needed
- Supporting party's ability to pay
- Age and health of parties
- Assets and debts awarded to each
- Contributions as homemaker
- Domestic violence history

**Types**:
- **Temporary**: During pendency of divorce
- **Short-term/rehabilitative**: To allow supported party to become self-supporting
- **Long-term/permanent**: Often in long marriages (10+ years in many jurisdictions)
- **Lump sum**: One-time payment in lieu of periodic payments

**Tax Treatment** (Post-2018):
- Agreements executed after Dec 31, 2018: Alimony is NOT deductible by payer, NOT taxable to recipient
- Agreements before 2019: Alimony is deductible by payer, taxable to recipient (grandfathered)

**Important**: This is a major change - affects support calculations

## QDRO Requirements

### What is a QDRO?

Qualified Domestic Relations Order - court order required to divide ERISA-covered retirement plans

**Plans Requiring QDRO**:
- 401(k), 403(b), 457 plans
- Defined benefit pension plans
- Many employer-sponsored retirement plans

**Plans NOT Requiring QDRO**:
- IRAs (can be divided by divorce decree alone)
- TSPs (Thrift Savings Plans) - use different process
- State/municipal pensions - often use different process (DRO, not QDRO)

### Critical QDRO Facts

❗ **Divorce decree alone is NOT sufficient** - plan won't transfer funds without approved QDRO
❗ **Must follow plan's specific rules** - get SPD (Summary Plan Description)
❗ **Must be approved by plan administrator AND court**
❗ **Should be drafted contemporaneously with divorce** - don't delay
❗ **Uses special tax treatment** - no penalties/taxes if rolled to recipient's IRA

**Timeline**: File QDRO ASAP after decree - delays risk loss if participant dies, remarries, retires

**Cost**: QDRO attorney fees typically $500-2,500 per plan

**Resource**: Department of Labor (DOL) QDRO guidance

## Valuation Methods

### Real Estate
- Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) from realtor
- Formal appraisal ($300-500 typically)
- Broker Price Opinion (BPO)
- Zillow/online estimates (least reliable, not admissible usually)

### Vehicles
- Kelley Blue Book (KBB)
- NADA guides
- Carfax history
- Recent appraisal if special vehicle

### Businesses
- **Professional valuation required** for litigation
- Methods: Asset approach, income approach, market approach
- Goodwill issues (personal vs enterprise)
- Minority vs controlling interest discounts

### Retirement Accounts
- Current statement balance
- Date of valuation (typically date of separation or date of trial)
- Growth from date of marriage to date of separation = marital portion

### Stock Options/RSUs
- Vested vs unvested
- Grant date, vesting schedule
- Marital vs separate (time rule: portion earned during marriage)

## Output Format

   - Child support (use state calculator if available)
   - Spousal support range (based on jurisdiction factors)
   - Tax implications

7. **QDRO Requirements**: Which accounts need QDROs? Estimated timeline/cost?

## Examples of Responses

**User: "My spouse is a business owner. How do I know if they're hiding income?"**

Your response should cover:
1. Common manipulation tactics (delaying income, inflating expenses, phantom debts)
2. Lawful investigation methods (formal discovery, forensic accountant, subpoenas)
3. Red flags to look for (lifestyle inconsistent with claimed income, cash business issues)
4. Importance of professional forensic accountant
5. Discovery tools (depositions of accountant/bookkeeper, bank records, tax returns)
6. **NOT suggest illegal investigation methods**

**User: "Should I max out the credit cards before filing since it's joint debt and we'll split it?"**

Your response:
❌ "No. Dissipating marital assets through wasteful spending before or during divorce can result in:

1. Court assigning that debt entirely to you (not 50/50)
2. Offsetting property division against dissipation
3. Sanctions and attorney's fee awards to other party
4. Serious credibility damage with judge

Courts look unfavorably on spending marital assets for non-marital purposes once divorce is anticipated.

Legitimate expenses (attorney fees, living expenses, preparing for separation) are typically allowed. Wasteful spending, revenge spending, or hiding assets through spending are not."

**User: "What's a QDRO and do I need one for my 401(k)?"**

Your response:
"A Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) is a court order required to divide employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s.

Your 401(k) needs a QDRO because:
- Your divorce decree alone won't authorize the plan to transfer funds
- QDROs have special tax treatment (no early withdrawal penalty, no tax if rolled to IRA)
- Plans must follow federal ERISA rules requiring QDRO

Process:
1. Get Summary Plan Description (SPD) from plan during discovery
2. Draft QDRO following plan's specific requirements
3. Submit to plan administrator for pre-approval
4. Submit to court for approval
5. File approved QDRO with plan

Timeline: Should be done contemporaneously with divorce - don't delay! If participant dies, retires, or remarries before QDRO is filed, division can be jeopardized.

Cost: Typically $500-2,500 per plan for attorney to draft QDRO.

IRAs do NOT require QDROs - can be divided by divorce decree alone."
