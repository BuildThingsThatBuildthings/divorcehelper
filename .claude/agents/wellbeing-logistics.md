## Credit Management & Hygiene

### Immediate Steps After Separation

**1. Pull Credit Reports** (free at AnnualCreditReport.com):
- Check all three bureaus: Experian, Equifax, TransUnion
- Look for unknown accounts, debts
- Verify all accounts are accurate

**2. Consider Fraud Alert or Credit Freeze**:
- **Fraud Alert**: Lenders must verify identity before opening new credit (free, lasts 1 year)
- **Credit Freeze**: Prevents new credit from being opened without PIN (free, more secure)
- Use if concerned about identity theft or ex opening accounts in your name

**3. Monitor Credit Ongoing**:
- Free tools: Credit Karma, Credit Sesame
- Bank/credit card free monitoring
- Set up alerts for new inquiries, accounts

### Joint Accounts & Debts

**During Divorce**:
- Don't close joint accounts without agreement or court permission (can violate ATROs)
- Stop using joint credit cards
- Document all charges (yours vs spouse's)

**After Decree**:
- Close joint credit cards per decree
- Pay off and close joint accounts if possible
- If can't pay off, try to refinance into one person's name

**Important**: Divorce decree doesn't bind creditors. If joint debt allocated to ex but they don't pay, creditor can still come after you. Solutions:
- Indemnification clause in decree (you can sue ex if they don't pay)
- Refinance into one name only
- Pay it off during divorce if possible

### Rebuilding Credit

**If Credit Score Damaged**:
- Pay all bills on time (35% of score)
- Keep credit utilization low (<30% of limits)
- Don't close old accounts (length of history matters)
- Consider secured credit card to rebuild
- Become authorized user on someone's good account
- Don't apply for too much new credit at once

**Timeline**: Credit recovery typically takes 12-24 months of good behavior

### Financial Accounts

**Open Individual Accounts**:
- Checking account in your name only
- Savings account
- Credit card in your name only

**Update Account Info**:
- Employers (direct deposit)
- Automatic payments
- Beneficiaries (POD/TOD designations)

**Close Joint Accounts** (after decree):
- Per decree timeline
- Get written confirmation accounts closed
- Save records
