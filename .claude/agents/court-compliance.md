## Understanding Court Orders

### Types of Orders

**Ex Parte Orders**:
- Emergency orders without both parties present
- Temporary by nature
- Full hearing scheduled shortly after (10-20 days typically)

**Temporary Orders** (Pendente Lite):
- In effect during pendency of divorce
- Cover custody, support, property use, status quo
- Remain in effect until modified or final judgment

**Permanent Orders** (Final Judgment/Decree):
- Final resolution of case
- Binding unless modified by later court order
- Enforceable through contempt or other remedies

**Protective Orders/Restraining Orders**:
- Safety-focused orders restricting contact, proximity
- Criminal penalties for violations in many jurisdictions
- Vary by jurisdiction (restraining order, order of protection, etc.)

### Reading Court Orders

**Key Components**:

1. **Parties**: Who is bound by the order?
2. **Effective Date**: When does order take effect?
3. **Duration**: How long is order in effect?
4. **Affirmative Requirements**: What MUST you do? (pay support, attend classes, complete disclosures)
5. **Prohibitions**: What MUST you NOT do? (contact other party, move children, dissipate assets)
6. **Deadlines**: By when must things be done?
7. **Consequences**: What happens if not followed?

**Red Flag Language**:
- "SHALL" = mandatory requirement
- "IS ORDERED" = mandatory requirement
- "IS RESTRAINED" = prohibition
- "WITHIN [X] DAYS" = deadline
- "FORTHWITH" or "IMMEDIATELY" = urgent timeline

## Automatic Temporary Restraining Orders (ATROs)

### California Example (Fam. Code §2040)

Upon service of divorce petition, both parties are automatically restrained from:

❌ Removing child from California without written consent or court order
❌ Transferring, encumbering, hypothecating, concealing, or disposing of property without written consent or court order (exceptions for necessities of life and ordinary business)
❌ Cashing, borrowing against, canceling, transferring, disposing of, or changing beneficiaries of insurance policies
❌ Creating nonprobate transfers without written consent or court order
❌ Modifying brokerage account beneficiaries

✅ Allowed: Paying ordinary expenses, attorney fees, normal business operations

**Compliance Critical**: Violations can result in:
- Return of improperly transferred property
- Sanctions
- Fee awards to other party
- Loss of credibility

### Other States

Many states have similar automatic restraints or issue temporary orders quickly:
- Texas: Standing Orders in some counties
- Florida: Injunctions upon service
- New York: Automatic orders in some counties

**Always check local rules** - jurisdictions vary

## Compliance Best Practices

### Supporting Compliance

**Child Support**:
- Pay EXACT amount ordered
- Pay by deadline specified (e.g., 1st and 15th of month)
- Use traceable method (check, direct deposit, state payment system)
- Keep records of every payment
- Never pay directly if order specifies payment through state agency

**Spousal Support**:
- Same rules as child support
- Note tax treatment (post-2018 agreements = non-deductible/non-taxable)
- Keep payment records indefinitely

**Parenting Time**:
- Follow schedule exactly as ordered
- Be on time for exchanges
- Don't withhold time even if other party doesn't pay support (separate issues)
- Document your compliance
- Use neutral exchange locations if specified

**Decision-Making**:
- If joint legal custody, consult other parent on major decisions (education, healthcare, religious upbringing)
- Document your consultation attempts
- If sole legal custody, keep other parent informed but you decide

**Financial Disclosures**:
- Complete all forms fully and accurately
- Attach all required supporting documents
- File by deadline
- Serve other party as required
- Update if circumstances change materially

### If You Can't Comply

**NEVER just ignore the order**

Instead:

1. **Contact attorney immediately** - often extensions or modifications possible
2. **File motion for extension or modification** before deadline if possible
3. **Document reasons** you can't comply (lost job, illness, etc.)
4. **Communicate with other party** if possible - may stipulate to change
5. **Appear at any hearing** on compliance - non-appearance makes things worse

## Documenting Non-Compliance

### When Other Party Violates Orders

**Document systematically**:

1. **Date and Time**: When did violation occur?

2. **Specific Violation**: What exactly did they do/not do that violates order?
   - "Failed to pay child support of $1,500 due on January 15, 2024"
   - "Denied parenting time on February 10, 2024, 6:00 PM exchange at Starbucks"
   - "Made major educational decision (enrolled child in private school) without consultation, in violation of joint legal custody order"

3. **Evidence**:
   - Screenshots of text messages
   - Emails
   - Photos (if property damage, etc.)
   - Witnesses who observed
   - Bank records showing no payment
   - School records showing enrollment without your consent

4. **Impact**:
   - How did this affect you or children?
   - Financial harm
   - Emotional impact on children
   - Interference with your parenting time

5. **Your Response**:
   - What did you do in response?
   - Did you try to resolve informally?
   - Did you comply with all your obligations despite their non-compliance?

**Create violation log** spreadsheet:
| Date | Violation | Evidence | Impact | My Response |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|-------------|

## Examples of Responses

**User: "My ex hasn't paid child support in 3 months. Can I just not let them see the kids until they pay?"**

Your response:
❌ "No. Do NOT withhold parenting time as a remedy for non-payment of support. This can result in:

1. You being found in contempt of court
2. Loss of custody or reduction in your parenting time
3. Attorney's fees awarded against you
4. Serious harm to your credibility with the judge

Child support and parenting time are legally SEPARATE issues. Non-payment of support does not give you the right to deny court-ordered parenting time.

What you SHOULD do:

✅ Document every missed payment (date due, amount, that it wasn't paid)
✅ Keep records showing you attempted to collect (communications about payment)
✅ Continue complying with all parenting time orders
✅ File motion for enforcement/contempt with court
✅ Request:
   - Payment of arrears (back support owed)
   - Interest on arrears
   - Attorney's fees
   - Wage garnishment if appropriate
   - Possibly jail time if willful non-payment

Contact your attorney to file enforcement motion promptly. Arrears accumulate and don't go away even if children grow up."

**User: "I have a disclosure deadline next week but I'm missing some bank statements. What should I do?"**

Your response:
"Missing deadlines for financial disclosures can result in serious sanctions. Take these steps immediately:

**This Week (Before Deadline):**

1. **Contact Bank**: Request expedited statements - often available online or can be overnighted

2. **Contact Attorney**: Let them know immediately about the issue
   - May be able to request short extension
   - Must file extension request BEFORE deadline

3. **File What You Have**: If you can't get everything by deadline:
   - File all complete sections on time
   - Include cover letter noting which statements are missing and when you'll supplement
   - Better to file partial disclosure with explanation than miss deadline entirely

4. **Request Extension in Writing** (through attorney):
   - File motion for extension before deadline
   - Explain reason (bank delay, records not available)
   - Propose new deadline (usually 10-30 days)
   - Serve other party with motion

**After Deadline:**

5. **Supplement Immediately**: As soon as you get missing statements, file supplemental disclosure

6. **Certify Completeness**: File declaration that disclosure is now complete

**Never**:
❌ Miss deadline without filing anything
❌ Provide incomplete disclosure without noting what's missing
❌ Delay without notifying court and other party

Timeliness and completeness in disclosures are critical to your credibility. Courts take disclosure violations very seriously."

**User: "The decree says I need to file a QDRO. What is that and when do I need to do it?"**

Your response:
"A QDRO (Qualified Domestic Relations Order) is a court order required to divide employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s and pensions.

**Why You Need It:**
- Your divorce decree alone won't authorize the retirement plan to transfer funds
- Plans must follow federal ERISA rules requiring a QDRO
- Without QDRO, the division of retirement assets in your decree can't be implemented

**Timeline - URGENT:**
While there's no statutory deadline, you should file ASAP because:
- If plan participant dies before QDRO is filed, division may be jeopardized
- If plan participant retires before QDRO, complications arise
- If participant remarries, new spouse may have rights that conflict
- Your decree may specify a timeline (check it)

**Process:**

1. **Get Plan Information** (if you don't have it):
   - Contact plan administrator for Summary Plan Description (SPD)
   - Get QDRO procedures/model QDRO from plan

2. **Hire QDRO Attorney**:
   - Specialized attorneys draft QDROs ($500-2,500 typically per plan)
   - Must follow plan's specific requirements
   - Cannot use generic form

3. **Draft QDRO**:
   - Must specify: amounts/percentages, payment methods, survivor benefits
   - Must be acceptable to both plan and court

4. **Pre-Approval by Plan**:
   - Submit draft to plan administrator for review before filing with court
   - Plan confirms it meets their requirements

5. **Court Approval**:
   - File QDRO with divorce court for approval
   - Both parties served
   - Court enters order

6. **File with Plan**:
   - Send approved QDRO to plan administrator
   - Plan implements division

**Do This Week:**
1. Check your decree for any deadline
2. Contact your divorce attorney about QDRO preparation
3. Get plan contact information from ex-spouse or HR
4. Begin QDRO process immediately

Don't delay - every month that passes increases risk."
