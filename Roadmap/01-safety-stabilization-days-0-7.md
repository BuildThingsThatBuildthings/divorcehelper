# Stage 1: Safety & Stabilization (Days 0-7)

*Written by: Safety & Crisis Agent*

## Overview

The first 7 days when divorce becomes a reality are critical for establishing safety and stability. Whether you've just decided to file, received divorce papers, or are contemplating separation, these initial days set the foundation for everything that follows.

**Why Days 0-7 Matter:**
- Safety risks can escalate during separation
- Financial access may be cut off
- Evidence may be destroyed
- Critical decisions about housing and children need immediate attention
- Your emotional state needs support to handle what's ahead

**Your Immediate Priorities:**
1. Ensure physical and emotional safety (you and children)
2. Secure access to essential resources (money, documents, housing)
3. Protect your digital presence and communications
4. Begin documenting your situation
5. Connect with support resources

## What to Expect

### Emotional Responses (All Normal)
- Shock, disbelief, numbness
- Overwhelming fear about the future
- Anger, rage, sense of betrayal
- Profound sadness and grief
- Relief (especially if leaving unhealthy/unsafe situation)
- Anxiety, panic attacks
- Difficulty sleeping, eating, concentrating
- Roller coaster of emotions within same day

**Remember:** These responses are normal reactions to major life upheaval. You're not "falling apart" - you're experiencing a natural response to crisis.

### Immediate Concerns People Face
- "Where will I live?"
- "How will I pay bills?"
- "What about the children?"

- "Do I need a lawyer right now?"

### Common Challenges in First Week
- Partner's reaction (anger, denial, counter-accusations, threats)
- Telling children (if applicable)
- Financial uncertainty
- Housing instability

- Isolation (not knowing who to tell)
- Technology concerns (is spouse monitoring you?)

## What Your Partner Might Do (Common Tactics)

### Financial Tactics
**Cutting off access:**
- Removing you from bank accounts
- Canceling credit cards
- Changing passwords on financial accounts
- Stopping direct deposit
- Taking your name off car/home insurance

**Counter:** Open individual account immediately. Document all joint accounts. File for temporary support orders. Attorney can request financial restraining orders.

**Hiding/spending assets:**
- Large cash withdrawals
- "Loans" to friends/family
- Gambling losses
- Luxury purchases
- Transferring assets to business or others

**Counter:** Screenshot/photograph all accounts and statements NOW. Request formal financial disclosures. Hire forensic accountant if needed. Court can award you dissipated funds.

### Technology & Surveillance Tactics
**Monitoring:**
- Installing spyware/tracking apps
- Using Find My Phone without consent
- Accessing your emails, texts, social media
- GPS trackers on vehicle
- Home surveillance cameras

**Counter:** Change all passwords, enable 2FA, get new phone/number if possible, check devices professionally, use friend's device for sensitive communications. Document surveillance for protective order. DO NOT retaliate with your own surveillance (illegal).

### Child-Related Tactics
**Gatekeeping:**
- Denying your time with children without legal basis
- Last-minute schedule changes
- Enrolling children in activities without consulting you
- Making unilateral decisions (school, medical, religious)
- Moving with children without notice

**Counter:** Document every denied visit with date/time/circumstances. Continue attempting to exercise parenting time. DO NOT withhold time in retaliation. File for temporary custody order immediately. Keep written communication showing you're trying to see children.

### Intimidation & Threats
**Creating fear:**
- Threats of violence
- Threats to "ruin you" financially/in custody
- Threats to call police/CPS with false claims
- Enlisting friends/family to pressure you
- Social media attacks, public humiliation

**Counter:** Document all threats (screenshots, save voicemails). Do NOT respond in kind. Stay calm and factual in all communications. Consider protective order for threats. Attorney can address false claims preemptively.

### Legal/Process Manipulation
**Abuse of process:**
- Filing frivolous motions to harass/drain resources
- Constantly changing attorneys
- Refusing to negotiate/attend mediation in good faith
- Ignoring court orders
- Intentionally delaying proceedings

**Counter:** Document bad faith behavior. Request attorney's fees from court. Move for sanctions if appropriate. Stay compliant with all orders yourself to maintain credibility.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid in First Week

### ❌ DON'T: Leave the marital home impulsively
**Why:** Can affect custody, property rights, and claims of abandonment in some states. If you need to leave for safety, do so, but consult attorney ASAP about implications.
**Instead:** If possible, consult attorney before moving out to understand consequences. If must leave for safety, document why and seek legal guidance immediately.

### ❌ DON'T: Empty joint bank accounts or max out credit cards
**Why:** Courts view this as dissipation of marital assets. You may have to pay it back, face sanctions, and damage your credibility.
**Instead:** Take only what you need for immediate expenses. Document the need. Leave remaining funds accessible to both parties.

### ❌ DON'T: Delete texts, emails, social media posts
**Why:** Once divorce is anticipated, you have duty to preserve evidence. Deletion = spoliation sanctions, adverse inferences, credibility damage.
**Instead:** Preserve everything. Back up to cloud or external drive. You can assert privilege over attorney communications later.

### ❌ DON'T: Install spyware or tracking on spouse's devices
**Why:** Illegal under federal and state law (CFAA, ECPA). Can result in criminal charges and torpedoed credibility in divorce.
**Instead:** Gather evidence lawfully. Hire licensed private investigator if needed. Formal discovery process exists for a reason.

### ❌ DON'T: Confront spouse about suspicions without support/safety plan
**Why:** Can escalate to violence. Can tip them off to start hiding assets. Can result in false counter-accusations.
**Instead:** Document your concerns. Consult attorney and therapist. If confrontation necessary, do so in safe, public location with support nearby.

### ❌ DON'T: Use children as messengers or confidants
**Why:** Emotionally harms children. Courts view very negatively. Undermines co-parenting before it starts.
**Instead:** Communicate directly with spouse (written method best). Keep adult problems away from children. Get therapist for YOUR emotional support.

### ❌ DON'T: Post about divorce on social media
**Why:** Everything you post can and will be used in court. Privacy settings don't matter - screenshots happen.
**Instead:** Complete social media silence about spouse, divorce, dating, partying, finances. Set all accounts to private. Better yet, take a break from social media.

### ❌ DON'T: Make major financial decisions alone (buying/selling big assets, quitting job)
**Why:** May violate automatic restraining orders. Court may view negatively. Can affect support calculations.
**Instead:** Maintain status quo financially. Consult attorney before major moves. If you must make changes (lost job), document circumstances.

### ❌ DON'T: Introduce children to new romantic partner
**Why:** Too much change too fast for kids. Courts view very negatively. Can be used against you in custody.
**Instead:** Wait until divorce final and children adjusted (many recommend 6+ months). When you do, go very slowly.

### ❌ DON'T: Refuse to communicate with spouse at all
**Why:** Need to address immediate child/financial issues. Court requires good faith communication. Creates more conflict.
**Instead:** Use BINF communication (Brief, Informative, Neutral, Firm). Written only (text, email). Child-focused. Professional tone like business correspondence.

## When to Move to Next Stage

You're ready for **Stage 2: Resolution Track Selection** when:

✅ Immediate safety is established (you and children are safe)
✅ Basic financial access secured (can pay bills, have some money)
✅ Critical documents gathered or photographed
✅ Support system identified (friends, family, therapist, attorney consultations)
✅ Immediate crisis has been contained
✅ You can think beyond survival to next steps
✅ Housing situation stabilized (know where you'll be next 30 days)
✅ If children: immediate temporary arrangements established

**Timeline:** Most people are ready to move to Stage 2 after 1-2 weeks, once initial shock has worn off and basic stability established.

**If you're not ready:** That's okay. Focus on THIS stage's priorities. Don't rush. Divorce is a marathon, not a sprint. Get therapy, lean on support, and take care of yourself.

---

**Remember:** You WILL get through this. One day, one step at a time. Focus on what you can control right now. Get support. You don't have to do this alone.
