# Stage 3: Pre-Filing Preparation (Weeks 1-3)

*Written by: Document & Evidence Agent + Financial Forensics Agent*

## Overview

Before filing for divorce (or responding to a petition), thorough preparation is essential. This stage focuses on two critical tasks: **gathering documentation** and **analyzing your financial situation**. The work you do now will save time, money, and stress later.

**Why Pre-Filing Prep Matters:**
- Courts require comprehensive financial disclosures (hiding information = sanctions)
- Missing documents delay proceedings and cost attorney time ($$$)
- Financial snapshot establishes marital standard of living for support calculations
- Evidence gathered lawfully now may not be accessible later
- Understanding your finances prevents unfair settlements
- Preparation strengthens negotiating position

**Timeline:** Most people spend 2-4 weeks on this stage, though complex financial situations may take longer.

# PART A: DOCUMENT COLLECTION

*From: Document & Evidence Agent*

## Document Sweep Overview

You need 12-36 months of financial records to paint complete picture of marital finances. Some jurisdictions require specific timeframes for disclosure. Better to have too much documentation than too little.

**Preservation Duty Begins NOW:** Once divorce is anticipated, you have legal duty to preserve all potentially relevant evidence. DO NOT delete texts, emails, social media posts, or documents. Deletion = spoliation sanctions + adverse inferences.

## Evidence Preservation - CRITICAL

### When Preservation Duty Begins

**NOW** - Once divorce is contemplated, filed, or you've been served, you have legal duty to preserve ALL potentially relevant:
- Documents (paper and electronic)
- Communications (texts, emails, social media, voicemails)
- Financial records
- Photos and videos
- Work documents showing income/hours
- Children's records

### What Must Be Preserved

**Everything that might be relevant to:**
- Income, assets, debts
- Marital standard of living
- Parenting/caregiving history
- Abuse or threats
- Substance abuse
- Adultery (if relevant in your jurisdiction)
- Dissipation of assets
- Hidden assets
- Any contested issue

**When in doubt, preserve it.** Better to have too much than delete something important.

### Consequences of Deletion (Spoliation)

Courts can impose:
- **Adverse inference** (assume deleted material was harmful to your case)
- **Sanctions** (fines, dismiss claims/defenses)
- **Attorney's fee awards** to other party
- **Contempt** findings
- **Loss of credibility** with judge (devastating)

### Preservation Methods

**Text Messages:**
- Screenshot with date/time visible
- Include context (who, what, when)
- Save to secure cloud
- Consider forensic preservation by professional

**Emails:**
- Export to PST/MBOX file (preserves metadata)
- PDF individual important emails
- Don't just leave in email client
- Include full email chains

**Social Media:**
- Screenshot posts (yours and spouse's public posts)
- Include date, time, poster name

**Documents:**
- Scan paper documents to PDF
- External drive backup
- Secure cloud backup (encrypted)

**Photos/Videos:**

## Red Flags: Partner Hiding or Destroying Documents

Watch for these warning signs:

⚠️ **Claiming documents "don't exist"** when you know they do
⚠️ **Refusing to provide** tax returns, bank statements
⚠️ **Large cash withdrawals** just before separation
⚠️ **Transferring assets** to friends/family

**What to do:**
1. Document what you observe (dates, what happened)
2. Gather what you can immediately before more is destroyed
3. Inform your attorney ASAP
4. Formal discovery and subpoenas will be needed
5. Court can impose sanctions for document destruction

## Timeline: How Long Does Gathering Take?

**Simple case**: 1-2 weeks
- Few bank accounts
- W-2 employees
- No business ownership
- Few assets

**Moderate complexity**: 2-4 weeks
- Multiple accounts
- Some investments

**Complex case**: 4-8 weeks

# PART B: FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

*From: Financial Forensics Agent*

Now that you're gathering documents, it's time to analyze your financial situation. This analysis informs negotiations, support calculations, and settlement strategies.

## Credit & Identity Protection

### Pull Credit Reports (Do This First)

**Why:** Discover unknown accounts, debts, or identity theft.

**How:**
1. Go to AnnualCreditReport.com (free official site)
2. Request reports from all 3 bureaus:
   - Experian
   - Equifax
   - TransUnion
3. Review for:
   - Accounts you don't recognize
   - Debts you didn't incur
   - Recent inquiries (spouse opening new credit?)
   - Address changes
   - Incorrect information

**What to do with findings:**
- Dispute errors immediately
- Document unknown accounts
- Report identity theft if applicable
- Share concerning findings with attorney

### Consider Fraud Alert or Credit Freeze

**Fraud Alert** (Easier, less secure):
- Lenders must verify identity before opening new credit
- Free
- Lasts 1 year (can renew)
- Doesn't stop you from opening credit (just adds verification step)

**Credit Freeze** (More secure):
- Prevents new credit from being opened without PIN
- Free
- You control when to lift (temporarily or permanently)
- More secure if concerned about spouse opening accounts in your name

**When to use:**
- Spouse has your SSN and financial info (they do)
- History of financial manipulation
- You won't need new credit during divorce
- Concerned about fraud

**How to freeze:**
- Contact all 3 bureaus separately
- Online process, takes minutes
- You'll receive PIN to lift freeze when needed

### Set Up Credit Monitoring

**Free options:**
- Credit Karma
- Credit Sesame
- Many banks/credit cards offer free monitoring

**What monitoring does:**
- Alerts you to new accounts
- Alerts you to inquiries
- Tracks credit score changes
- Early warning of identity theft

**Set up alerts for:**
- New credit inquiries
- New accounts opened
- Large changes to credit utilization
- Address changes

**What this shows:**

## Red Flags for Dissipation

Review financial statements for warning signs:

### Large Cash Withdrawals
- ATM withdrawals exceeding normal pattern
- Cash advances on credit cards
- Bank withdrawals shortly before separation
- **Example**: Normally withdraw $200/week, suddenly $2,000/week

### Transfers to Third Parties
- "Loans" to friends or family without documentation
- Payments to new people/entities
- Wire transfers to unknown accounts
- **Example**: $10,000 wire to spouse's sibling "for business investment"

### Unusual Spending
- Luxury purchases inconsistent with marital lifestyle
- Jewelry, trips, gifts for paramour
- Gambling losses (check credit card statements for casino charges)
- Excessive entertainment expenses
- **Example**: $5,000 shopping spree at jewelry store month before filing

### Business Manipulation (if business owner)
- Delaying receipt of income (deferring bonuses, client payments)
- Accelerating expenses (prepaying years of expenses)
- Inflating salary to employees (especially family/paramour)
- Creating phantom debts to business
- Underreporting revenue
- **Example**: Business that normally shows $200K income suddenly shows $50K loss

### Crypto & Hidden Assets
- Unexplained cryptocurrency purchases
- New accounts at crypto exchanges
- Transfers to wallets with unknown addresses
- **Example**: $25,000 bank withdrawal, then $25,000 Bitcoin purchase

### Asset Undervaluation
- Claiming assets worth less than market value
- Selling assets to friends/family below market (to buy back later)
- Allowing business to decline intentionally
- **Example**: $500K business "sold" to brother for $50K

**What to do if you spot dissipation:**
1. Document everything (dates, amounts, recipients)
2. Screenshot statements showing suspicious activity
3. Create timeline of dissipation
4. Inform attorney immediately
5. Request forensic accountant
6. Court can award you dissipated amounts

## Initial Characterization Analysis

Start thinking about which assets are marital vs separate:

**Generally MARITAL/COMMUNITY:**
- Assets acquired during marriage
- Income earned during marriage
- Retirement contributions during marriage
- Appreciation of separate property due to marital efforts
- Homes purchased during marriage (even if one name on title)

**Generally SEPARATE:**
- Assets owned before marriage
- Gifts to one spouse (from third party, not from spouse to spouse)
- Inheritances to one spouse
- Assets acquired after separation date (varies by state)
- Property acquired with separate property funds (if not commingled)

**TRACING Issues (Complex):**
- Separate property deposited in joint account (commingled)
- Separate property used for down payment on marital home
- Separate property business that grew during marriage
- Inheritance mixed with marital funds

**Action items:**
- Identify which assets you claim as separate
- Gather evidence of separate property character:
  - Pre-marital account statements
  - Gift letters
  - Inheritance documents
  - Date-of-marriage statements
- Don't commingle separate property NOW if you haven't already
- Consult attorney on tracing issues

- Spouse claims can't work/earn less
- Long absence from workforce
- Disability claims affecting support

**Cost:** $2,000-5,000

## QDRO Requirements

**Critical:** Most retirement accounts need Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) to divide them. Divorce decree alone is NOT sufficient.

**Accounts REQUIRING QDRO:**
- 401(k) plans
- 403(b) plans
- 457 plans
- Defined benefit pension plans
- Most employer-sponsored retirement plans covered by ERISA

**Accounts NOT requiring QDRO:**
- IRAs (Traditional, Roth, SEP, SIMPLE)
- Can be divided by divorce decree alone
- Rollover from ex-spouse's IRA to your IRA, tax-free

**QDRO Process:**
1. Get Summary Plan Description (SPD) from plan during discovery
2. Hire attorney specializing in QDROs ($500-2,500 per plan typically)
3. Draft QDRO following plan's specific requirements
4. Submit to plan administrator for pre-approval
5. Submit to court for approval
6. File approved QDRO with plan
7. Follow up to ensure processing

**Timeline:** URGENT - Do not delay! If participant dies, retires, or remarries before QDRO filed, division can be jeopardized.

**Flag all accounts needing QDROs NOW in your asset inventory.**
