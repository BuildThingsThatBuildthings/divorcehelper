## Overview

Protection during divorce isn't paranoia—it's prudence. When marriages end, some people act out of character, driven by fear, anger, or desperation. Even

 in amicable divorces, proactive protection prevents problems. This guide covers four protection domains: physical and digital safety, lawful evidence gathering, financial security, and shielding children from harm. Understanding your rights and boundaries empowers you to protect yourself legally and effectively.

---

## Part A: Physical and Digital Safety (safety-crisis agent)

### Assessing Your Safety Risk

**Red Flag Assessment:**
Rate each statement (0=Never, 1=Rarely, 2=Sometimes, 3=Often):
- Partner has physically harmed or threatened to harm you
- Partner controls where you go, who you see, what you do
- Partner monitors your phone, computer, location
- Partner has harmed or threatened to harm children/pets
- Partner's anger is escalating or unpredictable
- Partner abuses alcohol or drugs
- Partner has access to weapons
- Partner has threatened suicide or homicide
- Partner is extremely jealous or possessive
- You feel afraid of partner

**Score:**
- 0-5: Low risk (standard precautions)
- 6-12: Moderate risk (enhanced safety planning)
- 13-20: High risk (immediate safety plan + legal intervention)
- 20+: Severe risk (consider emergency shelter, protective orders)

### Physical Safety Planning

**Home Safety:**
- Change door locks (if legally permitted—check if you need permission)
- Install security cameras (exterior only, recording common areas)
- Security alarm system (monitoring service notifies police if triggered)
- Safe room: Interior room with lock, phone, exit route
- Remove or secure weapons (firearms, knives)
- Inform trusted neighbor of situation (they can call 911 if hear disturbance)

**Personal Safety:**
- Vary routine (leave/arrive home at different times, take different routes)
- Alert workplace security (provide photo of ex, instruct not to grant access)
- Park in well-lit, populated areas
- Carry charged phone at all times
- Trust your instincts (if you feel unsafe, you probably are—leave immediately)

**Safety with Children:**
- Teach children to call 911 in emergency
- Code word system ("If I say 'pineapple,' call grandma immediately")
- Explain to school: Only you (or approved persons) can pick up children
- Provide school/daycare with copy of custody orders, protective order (if any)

**Go-Bag (Ready to Leave Immediately):**
Store at trusted friend/family member's home or in locked car trunk:
- Copies of critical documents (ID, Social Security cards, birth certificates, custody orders, protection order, financial records, insurance cards)
- Cash ($500-$1,000)
- Spare phone charger, medications (2-week supply), spare eyeglasses
- Change of clothes for you and children
- Comfort items for children (small toy, photo)
- List of emergency contacts
- Copy of house/car keys

### Protective Orders (Restraining Orders)

**Types:**

**Emergency Protective Order (EPO):**
- Issued by police at scene of domestic violence call
- Immediate (lasts 5-7 days)
- Purpose: Temporary protection until you can get to court

**Temporary Restraining Order (TRO):**
- You file petition with court (ex parte—without ex present)
- Judge reviews, issues TRO same day if credible threat
- Lasts until hearing (typically 14-21 days)

**Permanent Restraining Order (3-5 Years):**
- After hearing where both parties present evidence
- If judge finds abuse/threats, issues 3-5 year order
- Can be renewed

**What Restraining Orders Do:**
- No contact (no calls, texts, emails, social media contact, third-party contact)
- Stay-away (minimum distance from you, your home, workplace, children's school)
- Move-out (if you're living together, abuser must leave)
- Custody/visitation (can specify supervised visitation or no contact with children)
- Surrender firearms (must turn in guns to police)

**How to Get Restraining Order:**
1. Go to courthouse (family court clerk)
2. Complete petition: Describe abuse/threats with specific dates, incidents
3. Judge reviews (same day or next day)
4. If granted: TRO issued, hearing scheduled (2-3 weeks)
5. Serve TRO on abuser (sheriff or process server)
6. Attend hearing: Present evidence (police reports, photos, medical records, witnesses)
7. If judge finds abuse: Permanent order issued

**Enforcement:**
- Violating restraining order = criminal offense (misdemeanor or felony)
- If ex violates: Call 911 immediately
- Police arrest violator
- Document every violation (for future hearings)

### Digital Safety (Technology-Facilitated Abuse)

**Phone Security:**
- Change all passwords (email, banking, social media, iCloud/Google)
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts
- Check phone for spyware: Settings > Battery > Look for unfamiliar apps using high battery
- Factory reset phone if you suspect spyware (back up data first)
- Disable location sharing (Find My iPhone, Google Maps, social media)
- Do NOT use shared phone plan if possible (ex may see call logs, texts)

**Computer Security:**
- Change passwords (use password manager like LastPass, 1Password)
- Check for keyloggers: Run malware scan (Malwarebytes, Windows Defender)
- Use private/incognito browsing for sensitive searches (doesn't save history)
- Clear browser history and cookies after each session
- Do NOT save passwords in browser if ex has access to your computer

**Email Security:**
- Create new email account (ex doesn't know about it)
- Use for legal communications, confidential matters
- Do NOT access from shared computer
- Enable 2FA

**Social Media:**
- Review privacy settings (make posts visible to friends only, not public)
- Remove ex and their family from friends list
- Do NOT post about divorce, legal proceedings, whereabouts, or new relationships
- Disable location tagging in photos
- Google yourself: See what information is publicly available

**GPS Tracking:**
- Check car for GPS trackers (under bumper, wheel wells, inside dashboard)
- Disable location services on phone except when actively using navigation
- If you find tracker: Photograph it, leave in place, tell attorney (evidence of stalking)

**Spyware Detection:**
- Phone suddenly drains battery quickly
- Phone overheats when not in use
- Unfamiliar apps appear
- Ex knows things they shouldn't know (where you went, who you talked to)
- **Action:** Factory reset phone, change all passwords

**Technology Safety Plan:**
- Use devices ex has never had access to for confidential communications
- Burner phone ($30 prepaid phone) for calling attorney, shelter, support
- Use friend's computer at library for research if home computer compromised

### Stalking and Harassment

**What Constitutes Stalking (Legal Definition):**
- Following you
- Repeated unwanted contact (calls, texts, emails, showing up at your home/work)
- Monitoring your activities
- Threatening behavior
- Two or more incidents that cause you reasonable fear

**Document Stalking:**
- Keep log: Date, time, location, what happened, witnesses
- Save all texts, emails, voicemails (don't delete)
- Take photos/screenshots
- Report to police (file report even if they don't arrest—creates record)

**Harassment via Children:**
- Ex sends messages through children ("Tell your mom she's a bitch")
- Ex interrogates children about your activities
- Ex uses parenting time exchanges to harass you
- **Protection:** Request supervised exchanges at neutral location, communication via co-parenting app only

---

## Part B: Lawful Evidence Gathering (document-evidence agent)

### What You CAN Do (Legally)

**Access to Information:**
- **Your own records:** You can access anything in your name or jointly
- **Marital home:** You can photograph, copy documents from marital home (even if ex says "that's mine")
- **Joint accounts:** You can access joint bank accounts, joint tax returns, joint bills
- **Your devices:** You can review your own phone, computer, email

**Permissible Actions:**
- Copy financial documents (bank statements, tax returns, credit card statements, loan documents, insurance policies, property deeds)
- Photograph condition of home, vehicles, assets
- Save emails/texts ex sent to you
- Record your own notes (observations, conversations you had with third parties)
- Request records from third parties where you're authorized user (joint credit cards, utilities in both names)

**Recording Conversations:**
- **One-Party Consent States (38 states):** You can record conversation if you're a participant (even if other party doesn't know)
- **Two-Party Consent States (12 states: CA, CT, FL, IL, MA, MD, MI, MT, NH, PA, WA, NV):** You cannot record unless all parties consent
- **Check your state's law before recording**

### What You CANNOT Do (Illegal)

**Illegal Access:**
- **Ex's email/social media:** Cannot hack into ex's email, Facebook, or other accounts (even if you know password)—federal crime (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act)
- **Ex's phone:** Cannot install spyware on ex's phone or read texts without permission—illegal wiretapping
- **Ex's computer:** Cannot access ex's password-protected computer without permission
- **Solely-owned accounts:** Cannot access bank account in ex's name alone (not joint)

**Illegal Recordings:**
- Cannot record conversation you're not part of (recording ex talking to their attorney, friend, new partner)
- Cannot install audio recording devices in ex's home or car
- Cannot record children to obtain information about ex (courts view this as alienation)

**Physical Intrusions:**
- Cannot break into ex's home (after separated and you no longer live there)
- Cannot take documents from ex's workplace
- Cannot go through ex's mail (federal crime)

**Consequences of Illegal Evidence Gathering:**
- Evidence inadmissible in court (can't use it even if proves your point)
- Criminal charges (wiretapping, hacking, trespassing, theft)
- Loss of credibility with judge
- Potential loss of custody (if violated laws to gather evidence)

### Preserving Evidence (Spoliation Prevention)

**What Is Spoliation:**
Destroying, altering, or concealing evidence relevant to litigation.

**Your Duty:**
From the moment divorce is anticipated, you have legal duty to preserve evidence (do NOT delete):
- Emails, texts, voicemails from ex
- Financial records (bank statements, tax returns, credit card statements, receipts)
- Photos, videos relevant to case
- Social media posts (yours and ex's—screenshot ex's posts before they delete)
- Documents related to assets, debts, income, parenting

**How to Preserve:**
- Do NOT delete emails (even ones that make you look bad)
- Do NOT delete texts
- Do NOT destroy documents (even if you think they're irrelevant)
- Do NOT edit or alter documents
- Back up everything (cloud storage, external hard drive)
- Print/PDF important emails and texts (in case account is closed)

**If You Accidentally Destroyed:**
- Tell your attorney immediately
- Attempt to recover (IT specialist can recover deleted files, phone companies have text logs)
- Disclose to court: "I accidentally deleted texts during spring cleaning before I knew they were relevant. I've attempted to recover but was unsuccessful."
- Accidental spoliation is less serious than intentional

**If Ex Destroys Evidence:**
- Document what you know was destroyed ("He deleted all texts from our joint phone account")
- Request sanctions (court can impose penalties, adverse inference—judge assumes destroyed evidence was unfavorable to ex)
- Seek alternative sources (phone company records, cloud backups)

### Documenting Abuse, Neglect, or Misconduct

**Credible Documentation:**
- **Written log:** Date, time, location, what happened, witnesses (handwritten in bound journal or typed with date/time stamps)
- **Photos:** Injuries (bruises, cuts), property damage, unsafe conditions at ex's home, children's distress
- **Videos:** Altercations (if legal to record), child's statements (if age-appropriate and not coached)
- **Medical records:** If injuries treated by doctor (doctor notes abuse)
- **Police reports:** Always call police if abuse occurs (creates official record)
- **Witnesses:** Names and contact info for anyone who saw incidents
- **Communications:** Save threatening texts, abusive emails, voicemails

**Child Abuse/Neglect Documentation:**
- Physical abuse: Photograph injuries, seek medical care (doctor's report), call police/CPS
- Neglect: Photos of unsafe home (no food, filthy, hazards), children's condition (dirty, hungry, sick)
- Emotional abuse: Document instances (ex berating child, calling names), child's distress (crying, anxiety, statements)
- **Do NOT coach children** ("Tell the judge Dad hurt you")—courts detect coaching and punish you

**Substance Abuse Documentation:**
- Ex's admission (text: "I got wasted last night")
- Witnesses seeing ex intoxicated during parenting time
- DUI arrest records
- Photos of alcohol/drug paraphernalia at ex's home
- Children's statements (not coached)

**Mental Health Documentation:**
- Ex's own statements about mental health issues
- Court-ordered evaluations
- Therapist records (if ex releases them)
- Behavioral observations (erratic behavior, suicide threats, inability to function)

**Domestic Violence Documentation:**
- Police reports (always call 911 if DV occurs)
- Photos of injuries
- Medical records
- Restraining order
- Witnesses
- Your written account (detailed, specific)

## Part C: Financial Protection (financial-forensics agent)

### Immediate Financial Safeguards

**First 48 Hours:**
1. **Document current financial position:**
   - Screenshot all account balances (checking, savings, credit cards, investments, retirement)
   - Note date and balance
   - Print or PDF (in case ex closes accounts)

2. **Open individual account:**
   - Bank account in your name only at different bank (not joint bank)
   - Deposit half of joint account balance (your share of community property)
   - Do NOT empty joint accounts (that's dissipation)

3. **Cancel joint credit cards or freeze them:**
   - Call credit card companies: Request freeze on joint cards (prevents new charges)
   - OR close joint cards (after paying balance or transferring to individual card)
   - Open credit card in your name only

4. **Credit report:**
   - Pull credit reports from all 3 bureaus (annualcreditreport.com)
   - Review for: Unknown accounts, debts you didn't authorize
   - Consider fraud alert or credit freeze

### Protecting Against Financial Misconduct

**Asset Dissipation Prevention:**
- Monitor joint accounts daily (online banking, set up alerts for transactions over $500)
- If you see large withdrawals, transfers, or unusual spending: Document, notify attorney immediately
- Court can impose sanctions for dissipation (waste of community assets)

**Common Financial Misconduct:**
- Emptying joint accounts
- Transferring assets to family members or new partner
- Running up joint credit cards for personal benefit (luxury purchases, new partner's expenses)
- Hiding income (cash business, receiving payment under table)
- Selling or giving away community property (cars, jewelry, collectibles)
- Taking money from business (if spouse owns business—excess draws, fake expenses)

**Your Response:**
- Document (bank statements, credit card statements showing misconduct)
- File emergency motion (request court freeze accounts, prohibit asset transfers)
- Request accounting (interrogatories, depositions forcing ex to explain where money went)
- Seek sanctions (court orders ex to reimburse community, pay your attorney fees)

### Credit Protection Strategy

**Freeze vs. Alert:**
- **Fraud Alert:** Alerts creditors to verify identity before opening new accounts (free, lasts 1 year)
- **Credit Freeze:** Locks credit report so no new accounts can be opened (free, stays until you unfreeze)
- **Recommendation:** Credit freeze if high risk (ex has your SSN, threatened to ruin you financially)

**How to Freeze Credit:**
1. Contact all 3 bureaus: Experian, Equifax, TransUnion
2. Request credit freeze (online, by phone, or mail)
3. Each bureau provides PIN (needed to unfreeze if you need to apply for credit)
4. Keep PINs secure

**Monitoring:**
- Pull credit reports every 3-6 months during divorce
- Look for: Unknown accounts, inquiries (someone applied for credit in your name), late payments on joint accounts
- Dispute errors immediately

### Budgeting and Financial Survival

**Create Separation Budget:**
- Income: Your earnings, temporary support (if any), other income
- Expenses: Housing, utilities, food, children, insurance, debt payments, attorney fees
- Shortfall: Income - Expenses = ? (if negative, how will you cover it?)

**Reducing Expenses:**
- Downsize housing (move to cheaper apartment/house)
- Cut non-essentials (dining out, entertainment, subscriptions)
- Negotiate bills (insurance, phone, internet—call and ask for discounts)
- Seek assistance (food banks, utility assistance programs, Medicaid, WIC)

**Increasing Income:**
- Second job or side gig
- Sell items you don't need
- Temporary support request (if not yet receiving)

**Emergency Fund:**
- Goal: 3-6 months expenses
- Even small amounts help ($50/week = $2,600/year)

### Protecting Business Interests (If You Own Business)

**If You Own Business:**
- Value business (hire business appraiser—ex is entitled to share of community interest)
- Protect business assets (ensure proper accounting, no commingling personal/business funds)
- Don't use business to hide income (court will impute income, impose sanctions)

**If Ex Owns Business:**
- Request business financials (tax returns, P&L, balance sheet, bank statements)
- Hire forensic accountant (detect income manipulation—paying personal expenses through business, deferring income, fake expenses)
- Subpoena business records if ex doesn't voluntarily produce

---

## Part D: Protecting Children (coparenting agent)

### Child-Centered Divorce Principles

**Golden Rule:**
Never put children in the middle. Children are not:
- Messengers ("Tell your dad he owes child support")
- Spies ("What does mom do at her house?")
- Therapists (don't vent to children about ex)
- Allies ("You're on my side, right?")
- Confidants (don't share adult information—finances, dating, legal issues)

**What Children Need:**
- Both parents' love and involvement (when safe)
- Stability and routine
- Freedom from conflict
- Age-appropriate information
- Permission to love both parents

### Shielding Children from Conflict

**Do NOT Do in Front of Children:**
- Argue with ex
- Badmouth ex ("Your father is a liar")
- Discuss divorce details (court, property division, support)
- Cry about divorce (occasional tears are human, but don't use children for emotional support)
- Interrogate children about ex ("Does dad have a girlfriend?")

**Do NOT Use Children As:**
- Message carriers (tell them to relay information to other parent—use email/text instead)
- Leverage ("If you don't pay support, you can't see the kids")
- Pawns (withholding parenting time to punish ex)
- Reporters (demanding they tell you everything that happens at other parent's home)

**Safe Communication:**
- Tell children: "Mom and Dad are getting divorced. It's not your fault. We both love you. You'll spend time with both of us."
- Answer questions age-appropriately (don't lie, but don't overshare)
- Reassure stability ("You'll still go to same school, see same friends")

### Recognizing Parental Alienation

**What Is Alienation:**
One parent's campaign to damage child's relationship with other parent.

**Alienating Behaviors (By Ex):**
- Badmouthing you to children ("Your mom abandoned us")
- Blocking your contact (not answering your calls to children, "forgetting" to give children phone messages)
- Limiting your parenting time (canceling visits, making excuses)
- Erasing you from child's life (removing photos of you, not mentioning you)
- Forcing child to choose ("Do you want to live with me or your dad?")
- Interfering with activities (scheduling events during your parenting time without consulting you)
- Discussing court case with children (telling them you're trying to take them away)

**Impact on Children:**
- Confusion and guilt (child feels torn between parents)
- Anxiety and behavioral issues
- Damaged relationship with targeted parent
- Long-term psychological harm

**Your Response:**
- Document alienation (specific instances, dates, what ex said/did)
- Don't retaliate (don't badmouth ex in response—be the bigger person)
- Reassure children ("I love you. It's not your job to choose. You can love both of us.")
- Continue involvement (attend school events, call children regularly, consistent parenting time)
- Seek court intervention (motion to modify custody, request therapy for children, parenting coordinator)
- Therapy (for children—therapist can identify alienation, provide support)

### When to Report Abuse or Neglect

**Mandatory Reporting:**
If you have reasonable suspicion of child abuse or neglect, you may need to report to Child Protective Services (CPS) or police. Some states require all adults to report; others only mandate certain professionals.

**What Constitutes Abuse:**
- **Physical abuse:** Hitting, shaking, burning, causing injury beyond reasonable discipline
- **Sexual abuse:** Any sexual contact with child
- **Emotional abuse:** Severe verbal abuse, threats, terrorizing, isolating
- **Neglect:** Failure to provide food, shelter, clothing, medical care, supervision

**When to Report:**
- You witness abuse
- Child discloses abuse to you
- You see injuries that raise suspicion
- Child's hygiene, nutrition, or safety is severely compromised at other parent's home

**How to Report:**
1. Call CPS hotline (typically 24/7) or police if emergency
2. Provide: Child's name, age, address, description of abuse/neglect, perpetrator's name
3. CPS investigates (interviews child, parents, checks home)
4. CPS determines: Substantiated (abuse occurred), unsubstantiated (not enough evidence), or unfounded (didn't occur)
5. If substantiated: CPS may remove child, require supervision, mandate services, refer for prosecution

**Caution About False Reports:**
Do NOT file false CPS reports to gain custody advantage. Consequences:
- CPS investigation diverts resources from actual abuse cases
- Harms children (traumatic to be interviewed by CPS)
- Harms you (court punishes false reporters—loss of custody, sanctions)
- Criminal charges (filing false report is crime in many states)

Only report if you genuinely believe abuse is occurring.

### Custody Evaluation Preparation (If Ordered)

**What Evaluator Looks For:**
- Parenting capacity (each parent's ability to meet child's physical, emotional, educational needs)
- Parent-child relationship (attachment, responsiveness, warmth)
- Child's preferences (if age-appropriate)
- Mental health of parents and children
- Domestic violence or substance abuse
- Parental cooperation (ability to co-parent)
- Home environment (safe, clean, child-appropriate)

**How to Prepare:**
- **Be honest:** Evaluator will uncover lies; lying destroys credibility
- **Focus on child:** "I want what's best for my child" not "I want to win"
- **Show involvement:** Bring records of school attendance, medical appointments, extracurriculars you attended
- **Home visit:** Clean, child-friendly home (child's bedroom, toys, books)
- **Don't badmouth ex:** Evaluator sees through it; shows inability to co-parent
- **Follow court orders:** Show you comply with temporary custody orders

**What NOT to Do:**
- Coach children ("Tell the evaluator you want to live with me")
- Criticize ex constantly (focus on facts, not attacks)
- Act entitled ("I'm the mother, I should have custody")
- Ignore evaluator's questions or be defensive

**After Evaluation:**
- Review report (evaluator provides recommendations)
- If unfavorable: Consider rebutting with own expert, cross-examining evaluator at trial
- If favorable: Use report as evidence in settlement negotiations or trial
