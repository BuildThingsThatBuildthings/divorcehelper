# Custody Evaluation Preparation Guide
*Week-by-Week Timeline for Mastering Your Custody Evaluation*

---

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive week-by-week preparation plan for custody evaluations. Most parents have 4-8 weeks' notice before evaluation begins. Use every day wisely—thorough preparation often determines custody outcomes.

**What's at Stake:** Custody evaluator's recommendation carries significant weight with judges. Many judges defer to evaluator's recommendation entirely. Winning the evaluator often means winning custody.

**Your Goal:** Present as child-focused, reasonable, well-prepared parent who genuinely provides best environment for child.

## Interview Question Bank

### Questions About Your Child

**Basic Knowledge:**
- "Tell me about your children."
- "What are your children's strengths and weaknesses?"
- "What is each child's personality like?"
- "What are your children's interests and hobbies?"
- "Who are your children's friends?"
- "What subjects do your children like/struggle with in school?"
- "What are your children's favorite foods? Least favorite?"
- "What are your children afraid of?"
- "How do your children handle stress or change?"

**Good Answer Strategy:**
- Detailed, specific, shows deep knowledge
- Speaks to each child individually (not generic)
- Balance (acknowledge strengths AND challenges)
- Demonstrates emotional attunement

**Example:**
"Emily is 8. She's sensitive and introverted. She loves reading—Harry Potter is her current obsession. She's great at English and art but struggles with math, so we practice together every evening. She has a close friend group—Sophia, Mia, and Ava from her class. She's afraid of the dark, so we have a nightlight routine. She handles change well if I prepare her in advance—surprises make her anxious."

### Questions About Parenting History

- "Walk me through a typical day with your children."
- "Describe your morning routine with the children."
- "How do you handle homework?"
- "What's bedtime like?"
- "How involved are you in your children's education?"
- "How involved are you in your children's medical care?"
- "How involved are you in your children's extracurricular activities?"
- "Who has been the primary caregiver?"
- "How did you and [other parent] divide childcare responsibilities during the marriage?"

**Good Answer Strategy:**
- Specific, detailed daily routines (shows involvement)
- Concrete examples with times, activities
- Demonstrate consistency and structure
- Honest about division of labor (don't exaggerate, but be clear about your role)

**Example:**
"A typical school day: I wake Emily at 6:30am. We pick out her outfit together—she likes matching. At 7am we have breakfast—usually oatmeal with berries. I pack her lunch while she eats—sandwich, fruit, veggie, healthy snack. At 7:30am we brush teeth, do hair, grab backpack. I drive her to school at 7:45am and walk her to her classroom. I talk to her teacher most mornings... [Continue through pickup, homework, dinner, bedtime with similar detail]"

### Questions About Parenting Skills

- "How do you discipline your children?"
- "Describe a time you had to discipline [child]. What did you do?"
- "How do you handle tantrums or meltdowns?"
- "How do you teach your children right from wrong?"
- "How do you handle conflict between siblings?"
- "How do you balance structure and flexibility?"
- "How do you support your children emotionally?"
- "How do you help your children with difficult emotions like sadness or anger?"

**Good Answer Strategy:**
- Age-appropriate discipline
- Calm, consistent, logical consequences
- Teaching moments (not just punishment)
- Emotional attunement and support

**Example:**
"I use natural consequences and time-outs. For example, last week Emily refused to do her homework. I calmly explained that if she didn't complete it, she wouldn't be able to watch her show after dinner. She chose not to do homework, so she lost the privilege. She was upset, but I stayed calm and explained that choices have consequences. The next day, she did her homework without prompting."

### Questions About Your Strengths & Weaknesses

- "What are your strengths as a parent?"
- "What are your weaknesses as a parent?"
- "What would you like to improve about your parenting?"
- "Describe a time you made a mistake as a parent. What did you learn?"

**Good Answer Strategy:**
- Honest about strengths (specific examples)
- Honest about weaknesses (shows insight, self-awareness)
- Frame weaknesses as areas you're working on (growth mindset)
- Never claim to be perfect (not credible)

**Example - Strengths:**
"I'm patient and consistent. Emily knows the rules and what to expect. I don't yell or lose my temper easily. I'm also very involved—I show up to her games, conferences, appointments. She knows she can count on me."

**Example - Weaknesses:**
"Sometimes I struggle with work-life balance. I want to provide financially, but I also want to be present. I've worked on this by adjusting my schedule to be more flexible. I've also learned to say no to extra projects at work so I can prioritize time with Emily."

### Questions About the Other Parent

- "How would you describe [other parent] as a parent?"
- "What are [other parent]'s strengths as a parent?"
- "What are your concerns about [other parent]'s parenting?"
- "Do you think [other parent] loves the children?"
- "How do you communicate with [other parent]?"
- "Describe your co-parenting relationship."
- "How do you handle disagreements about the children?"

**Good Answer Strategy (CRITICAL - Easy to Mess This Up):**
- Acknowledge other parent's positive qualities first (shows you're not alienating)
- Raise legitimate concerns factually, not emotionally
- Child-focused (how concerns affect child, not how they affect you)
- Balanced tone (not attacking, not vindictive)
- Show willingness to co-parent despite difficulties

**Example:**
"[Other parent] loves the children. When [he/she] is present, [he/she] can be fun and engaging. My concerns are about consistency and follow-through. [Other parent] has missed multiple scheduled visits—15 in the past 6 months. The children are disappointed each time. I've tried to communicate about this, but [other parent] doesn't respond to my texts or emails. I want the children to have a relationship with [other parent], but the inconsistency is harmful to them emotionally."

**RED FLAG ANSWERS TO AVOID:**
❌ "[Other parent] is a terrible parent"
❌ "[Other parent] doesn't love the kids"
❌ "[Other parent] only cares about [him/herself]"
❌ "I can't co-parent with [other parent] at all"
❌ Emotional, angry tone

### Questions About Co-Parenting

- "How willing are you to facilitate the children's relationship with [other parent]?"
- "What would you do if the court awards custody to [other parent]?"
- "How flexible are you about visitation schedule?"
- "Have you ever denied [other parent] time with the children? Why?"

**Good Answer Strategy:**
- Show willingness to facilitate (even if you believe you should have primary custody)
- Demonstrate flexibility and reasonableness
- Frame any denials as legitimate (safety concerns, court order violations)

**Example:**
"I absolutely want the children to have a relationship with [other parent]. If the court awards custody to [other parent], I would respect that decision and focus on being the best parent I can be during my time with the children. I'm flexible about the schedule when possible—if [other parent] has a special event, I try to accommodate. My priority is the children's wellbeing and their relationships with both parents."

**Trap Question:**
"Do you think [other parent] loves the children?"

**Right Answer:** "Yes, I believe [other parent] loves the children."
**Wrong Answer:** "No" or qualified answer (shows alienation)

### Questions About Proposed Custody Arrangement

- "What custody arrangement are you seeking?"
- "Why do you think this arrangement is in the children's best interests?"
- "How would you facilitate [other parent]'s relationship with the children under your proposed arrangement?"

**Good Answer Strategy:**
- Specific custody schedule (days, times, holidays)
- Child-focused reasons (stability, school, activities, needs)
- Show willingness to facilitate other parent's relationship
- Balance (not cutting other parent out)

**Example:**
"I'm requesting primary physical custody, with the children residing with me during the school year and having visitation with [other parent] every other weekend and one evening per week. During summer, I propose an extended visitation period for [other parent]. This arrangement provides stability for the children—they stay in their current school, maintain friendships, and continue their activities. It also ensures they have regular, consistent time with [other parent]. I will facilitate all visitation and ensure they stay connected through calls and video chats between visits."

### Questions About Your Life & Circumstances

- "Tell me about your work. What's your schedule?"
- "How do you balance work and parenting?"
- "Who provides childcare when you're working?"
- "Tell me about your living situation."
- "Do you have a support system? Who helps you?"
- "Are you in a relationship? Tell me about your partner."
- "Do you have any health issues? Mental health concerns?"
- "Have you used drugs or alcohol? How much?"

**Good Answer Strategy:**
- Honest about circumstances
- Demonstrate stability (steady work, stable housing)
- Show you have support system (not isolated)
- Address any concerns proactively (mental health managed, no substance issues, partner appropriate)

**Example - Work:**
"I work full-time as [job title]. My hours are 8am-4pm Monday-Friday, which allows me to do school pickup. My employer is family-friendly—if Emily is sick, I can work from home or take time off. I've worked there for 8 years, so I have job security and good relationships with my supervisors."

**Example - Mental Health:**
"I was diagnosed with anxiety five years ago. I see a therapist monthly and take medication as prescribed by my doctor. My anxiety is well-managed and doesn't affect my parenting. If anything, therapy has made me a better parent—I've learned coping skills that I can teach Emily."
