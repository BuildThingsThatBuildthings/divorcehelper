## Section 4: Custody Evaluation Deep Dive

### Understanding the Evaluation Process

**When Evaluations Are Ordered:**
- Contested custody cases where parents can't agree
- Allegations of abuse, neglect, substance use, or parental unfitness
- Relocation disputes
- Modification requests when circumstances have changed
- High-conflict cases where judge needs expert opinion

**Who Orders Evaluation:**
- Judge orders evaluation (sometimes at attorney request, sometimes on judge's own motion)
- Cost typically split between parents (unless one parent ordered to pay)
- Timeline: 3-6 months typical (longer for complex cases)

**Evaluator's Role:**
- Neutral expert (psychologist, social worker, psychiatrist)
- Conduct interviews, home visits, psychological testing, collateral interviews
- Review documents (pleadings, school records, medical records, police reports)
- Interview children (if old enough)
- Make custody recommendation to court

**Weight of Evaluation:**
- Not binding on judge BUT heavily influential
- Judges often adopt evaluator's recommendation (80-90% of cases)
- Overcoming negative evaluation requires strong contrary evidence and expert testimony

**Your Goal:**
- Win evaluator's recommendation for your custody proposal
- Present yourself as stable, child-focused, cooperative, fit parent
- Demonstrate child thrives in your care
- Show other parent's limitations or problems

### Home Visit Preparation

**Timeline: 4-6 Weeks Before Visit**

**Safety Assessment:**
- [ ] Smoke detectors working (test, replace batteries)
- [ ] Carbon monoxide detectors working
- [ ] Outlet covers on unused outlets (if young children)
- [ ] Stair gates if needed (toddlers)
- [ ] Pool fence/gate if applicable
- [ ] Medications locked away
- [ ] Cleaning supplies locked away
- [ ] Weapons secured (guns in safe with trigger locks, ammunition separate)
- [ ] No obvious hazards (sharp objects accessible, unstable furniture, broken items)
- [ ] Windows have locks, screens intact
- [ ] First aid kit accessible to you (not children)

**Cleanliness (Not Sterile, But Organized):**

- [ ] Floors clean (vacuumed/swept, no sticky residue)
- [ ] No strong odors (pet urine, smoke, garbage)

**Child-Focused Home:**
- [ ] Child's bedroom set up (own bed, dresser, age-appropriate decor)
- [ ] Child's artwork displayed (on fridge, walls, bulletin board)
- [ ] Age-appropriate toys accessible (not put away in closets - should look lived-in)

- [ ] Close to school (or reasonable commute)
- [ ] Near child's activities (sports, lessons)
- [ ] Near child's friends (playmates nearby)

**Day of Visit:**

**Preparation:**
- Professional but casual dress (not too formal, not sloppy)
- Home comfortable temperature

**During Visit:**
- **Be yourself** (don't act fake, evaluator will notice)
- **Be calm and welcoming** (friendly, not defensive)
- **Tour of home** (show child's room first, play areas, homework space)
- **Answer questions honestly** (not defensively)
- **Focus on child** (everything about child's needs, not your wants)
- **Observe evaluator's reactions** (note what they're interested in, take mental notes)
- **Provide evidence** (give evaluator your prepared binder of documentation)

**Evaluator Will Observe:**
- Interaction between you and child (natural, warm, responsive)
- Child's comfort level at home (does child seem relaxed, happy)
- Child's behavior with you (affectionate, seeking you out, or fearful/distant)
- Your parenting (how you handle questions, discipline, guidance)
- Home suitability (safety, cleanliness, child-appropriate)

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Overly rehearsed interaction with child (coaching is obvious)

- You speaking for child (not letting child answer evaluator's questions)
- Badmouthing other parent in front of child
- Defensive or hostile attitude
- Inappropriate sleeping arrangements
- Safety hazards
- Excessive alcohol visible
- New romantic partner present (especially if recently introduced)

Good answer:
- Detailed description of each child's personality, interests, strengths, challenges
- Specific examples showing you know them well
- Age-appropriate understanding of developmental stage
- Proud but realistic (acknowledge challenges, not just perfect child)

Bad answer:
- Generic ("they're great kids")

- Acknowledge what's working (not everything is bad)

Bad answer:
- Attack on other parent's character

**Parenting History Questions:**

**"Who has been the primary caregiver?"**

Good answer:
- Honest assessment backed by specifics
- Quantify division of tasks (percentages)
- Acknowledge other parent's involvement where it exists
- Provide examples (daily routine, who did what)

Bad answer:
- Claiming 100% caregiving when other parent was involved

- Vague, no specifics
- Defensive when asked to elaborate

**"Describe a typical day with your children."**

Good answer:
- Detailed, hour-by-hour description

- Age-appropriate routines (homework time, extracurriculars, bedtime)
- Consistent pattern (shows routine exists)

Bad answer:
- Vague ("we just hang out")
- Minimal involvement described (child does everything themselves)
- Inconsistent (different every day, no structure)
- Overly perfect (not realistic)

**"How do you discipline your children?"**

Good answer:
- Age-appropriate methods (time-outs, loss of privileges, natural consequences)
- Consistent approach (same rules and consequences)
- Teaching/guidance, not just punishment ("I explain why behavior was wrong, help them problem-solve")

- Do it for them (not teaching)
- Unaware of child's schoolwork
- Conflicts around homework (yelling, frustration)

**Co-Parenting Questions:**

**"How do you communicate with the other parent?"**

Good answer:
- Business-like, child-focused communication
- Use email/text to document (create record)
- Respond to necessary communications despite conflict
- Keep child out of adult conflicts
- Example: "We use email for scheduling and child's needs. I keep communications brief and focused on [child]. Despite our differences, I respond promptly when it's about [child]."

Bad answer:
- "I don't" or "Only through attorneys"
- "Everything is their fault"
- Hostile tone evident
- Use child as messenger

**"Can you describe your co-parenting relationship?"**

Good answer:
- Acknowledge challenges honestly
- Focus on what you DO to make it work
- Child-focused approach despite conflict
- Willingness to improve relationship for child's sake
- Example: "It's difficult. We have different parenting styles and past conflicts. But I focus on [child]'s needs. I attend school events even if [other parent] will be there. I facilitate [other parent]'s time with [child]. I'm willing to work on communication for [child]'s benefit."

Bad answer:
- All negative, all other parent's fault
- Unwilling to communicate or cooperate
- Use of child as weapon
- Refusal to see other parent's perspective at all

**"How do you feel about the other parent's relationship with the children?"**

TRAP QUESTION - Testing for alienation

Good answer:
- Acknowledge positive aspects of other parent's relationship with child
- Support child having relationship with both parents
- Express concerns appropriately (if legitimate) without denigrating
- Example: "I believe [child] loves [other parent] and I support that relationship. [Other parent] has strengths like [specific example]. My concerns are about [specific parenting issues], not about [other parent] as a person or their love for [child]."

Bad answer:
- All negative about other parent
- Undermining other parent's relationship ("child doesn't really want to see them")
- Denial of other parent's love for child
- Clear alienation

**Self-Awareness Questions:**

**"What are your strengths and weaknesses as a parent?"**

Good answer:
- Honest self-assessment
- Strengths backed by examples
- Real weaknesses acknowledged (not fake ones like "I care too much")
- Growth mindset (working on improvement)
- Example: "Strengths: patient, involved in school/activities, provide structure. Weaknesses: Sometimes too rigid with schedule, working on flexibility. Can be overprotective, learning to give [child] more independence as they mature."

Bad answer:
- No weaknesses ("I'm a perfect parent")
- Fake weaknesses ("I love them too much")
- Defensive about weaknesses
- Weaknesses that are concerning (admitting inappropriate discipline, neglect)

**"How has the divorce affected your parenting?"**

Good answer:
- Acknowledge stress but describe coping strategies
- Focus on maintaining stability for child
- Proactive about addressing own needs (therapy, support system)
- Example: "It's been stressful, but I've prioritized maintaining routine for [child]. I'm in therapy to process my emotions separately from parenting. I ensure [child] sees me managing stress healthily. I've worked to keep [child]'s life as stable as possible."

Bad answer:
- Minimize impact ("no effect at all" - unrealistic)
- Blame everything on other parent
- No insight into how stress affects parenting
- Admit to negative impact on child without addressing it

**Red Flag Questions (More Traps):**

**"Do you think the other parent loves the children?"**

Correct answer: "Yes, I believe [other parent] loves [child]."

Why: Shows you're not alienating. Even if other parent has problems, you acknowledge their love for child. Focus on behaviors/actions, not feelings.

Wrong answer: "No" or qualified ("I don't know" / "If they did, they would...")

Why: Shows alienation. Undermines child's relationship with other parent. Major red flag for evaluator.

**"What would you do if the court awards custody to the other parent?"**

Correct answer: "I would be disappointed, but I would respect the court's decision and focus on maintaining a positive relationship with [child] during my parenting time. I would continue to be involved in [child]'s life and support [his/her] relationship with [other parent]."

Why: Shows you're child-focused, not just winning-focused. Demonstrates you won't undermine order or alienate child.

Wrong answer: "I would appeal" / "That would never happen" / "I'd fight it" / "Child would be miserable"

Why: Shows you're focused on winning, not child's adjustment. Suggests you'd make it harder for child if you lose.

**"How often does the other parent call/see the children?"**

Be accurate and neutral:
- Don't exaggerate lack of contact (evaluator will verify)
- Don't be defensive if other parent has regular contact
- Acknowledge other parent's involvement where it exists
- If there are problems, state facts without emotion

Example (if true): "Per our temporary order, [other parent] has [child] every other weekend and Wednesday evenings. [Other parent] has canceled approximately [X] visits in the past [time period], typically due to [stated reasons]. [Other parent] calls [child] on non-custody days about [frequency]."

**"Tell me about [specific allegation other parent made about you]."**

Strategy:
- Stay calm, not defensive
- Address allegation directly, not dismissively
- Provide facts contradicting allegation
- Offer evidence
- Context if allegation has kernel of truth but misrepresented

Example:
Allegation: "You have anger problems."

Response: "I understand [other parent] feels that way, particularly from our past conflicts during marriage. I have sought therapy to learn better communication and stress management. I don't believe I have an anger problem that affects my parenting. [Child] is never exposed to inappropriate expressions of anger. I'd be happy to have my therapist provide a letter addressing this concern. I can also provide statements from [teacher, coach, etc.] who can speak to my demeanor with [child]."

**End of Interview Questions:**

**"Is there anything else you'd like me to know?"**

Use this opportunity:
- Reiterate your strengths as parent (briefly)
- Emphasize child's wellbeing in your care
- Provide any final important evidence
- Express willingness to cooperate with evaluation
- Thank evaluator for their time and thoroughness

Example: "I just want to emphasize that [child]'s wellbeing is my priority. [He/she] thrives in my care, as shown by [specific evidence - grades, activities, health]. I'm committed to co-parenting as effectively as possible despite the challenges. I've provided extensive documentation in the binder I gave you, and I'm happy to provide any additional information you need. I trust your expertise in making a recommendation that serves [child]'s best interests. Thank you for your time and care in evaluating this case."

### Psychological Testing Preparation

**Common Tests in Custody Evaluations:**

**1. MMPI-2 (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2)**
- Most common personality test in custody evaluations
- 567 true/false questions
- Takes 60-90 minutes
- Assesses psychopathology, personality traits

**2. PAI (Personality Assessment Inventory)**
- 344 questions, 4-point scale
- Alternative to MMPI-2
- Assesses clinical syndromes, treatment concerns, interpersonal style

**3. Rorschach Inkblot Test**
- Projective test (10 inkblots, describe what you see)
- Assesses thought patterns, emotional functioning, reality testing
- Controversial but still used

**4. Parenting Stress Index (PSI)**
- Measures stress in parent-child relationship
- Child characteristics, parent characteristics, life stress

**5. Other Possible Tests:**
- Beck Depression Inventory
- Beck Anxiety Inventory
- MCMI (Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory)
- PCL-R (Psychopathy Checklist) if domestic violence alleged
- IQ testing
- Substance abuse screening

**MMPI-2 Strategy:**

**Understanding Validity Scales (Detect Dishonesty):**

These scales catch people trying to look good or fake illness:
- **L Scale (Lie)**: Measures claiming unrealistic virtue ("I never tell lies" - nobody is that perfect)
- **F Scale (Infrequency)**: Measures exaggerating symptoms or random answering
- **K Scale (Defensiveness)**: Measures defensiveness, hiding problems
- **VRIN/TRIN**: Random or inconsistent responding

**How to Score Well on Validity Scales:**
- Answer honestly, not perfectly
- Admit to minor flaws everyone has ("Sometimes I procrastinate" - True)
- Don't try to appear perfect (L scale will catch you)
- Don't exaggerate problems (F scale will catch you)
- Be consistent (questions repeated in different forms - answer same way)

**Clinical Scales:**

Ten main scales measuring psychological issues:
1. Hypochondriasis (health preoccupation)
2. Depression
3. Hysteria (emotional overreaction)
4. Psychopathic Deviate (antisocial behavior)
5. Masculinity-Femininity
6. Paranoia
7. Psychasthenia (anxiety, obsessive thoughts)
8. Schizophrenia (thought disorder)
9. Hypomania (elevated mood, impulsivity)
10. Social Introversion

**Strategy for Clinical Scales:**
- Answer honestly
- Elevated scores don't necessarily disqualify you (treatment compliance matters)
- Mild elevation normal (everyone has some issues)
- Extreme elevation concerning (suggests psychopathology)

**Sample MMPI-2 Questions:**
- "I like to read newspaper articles on crime." (True/False)
- "At times I have very much wanted to leave home." (True/False)
- "I am easily awakened by noise." (True/False)
- "I have never done anything dangerous for the thrill of it." (True/False - most people have, so "False" is honest)
- "I worry about money." (True/False - most parents do, "True" is normal)

**General Strategy:**
- Answer naturally, not strategically
- Don't overthink questions
- Consistency is key (questions repeated, answer the same)
- Mild elevation on depression/anxiety normal for someone going through divorce
- Don't try to appear perfect (will backfire)

**PAI Strategy:**

Similar to MMPI-2:
- 4-point scale (False, Slightly True, Mainly True, Very True)
- Has validity scales like MMPI
- Answer honestly, consistently
- Don't exaggerate or minimize

**Rorschach Strategy:**

**What It Measures:**
- Thought organization (logical vs disordered thinking)
- Emotional regulation (how you process feelings)
- Reality testing (see things most people see, or bizarre responses)
- Interpersonal functioning (how you relate to others)

**How to Respond:**
- See common things (animals, people, nature, objects)
- Don't see bizarre things (blood, violence, sexual content unless clearly there)
- Quality over quantity (detailed responses show intelligence)
- Don't overthink (first impression usually best)
- It's okay to see different things (no "right" answer)

**Example:**
Card with inkblot that looks like bat/butterfly
- Good response: "I see a butterfly or bat, with wings spread"
- Concerning response: "I see blood dripping from a monster's face"

**Parenting Stress Index Strategy:**

**What It Measures:**
- Parent distress (your stress level)
- Parent-child dysfunctional interaction (conflict in relationship)
- Difficult child (child's challenging behaviors)

**Strategy:**
- Be honest about normal parenting stress (everyone has some)
- Emphasize coping strategies ("When I feel stressed, I...")
- Acknowledge child's challenging moments but also strengths
- Show awareness of child's needs and your adaptability

**Example:**
Question: "I feel trapped by my responsibilities as a parent."

Honest answer if going through divorce: Might be "Sometimes" (True)
But add context in interview: "Divorce has been stressful and I've felt overwhelmed at times, but I've sought support through therapy and family. I don't resent my responsibilities to [child]; I'm committed to being the best parent I can be."

**Substance Abuse Screening:**

If you have history:
- Be honest about past use and timeframe
- Emphasize recovery (length of sobriety, treatment completion, ongoing support)
- Offer to test (hair follicle test shows 90 days, proves current sobriety)
- Provide documentation (treatment records, AA attendance, sponsor letter)

If you don't have substance abuse history:
- Answer honestly, should be straightforward
- Expect confirmation testing (urine, hair follicle, breathalyzer)
- This is easy test to pass if you're sober

**General Testing Tips:**

**Before Testing:**
- Good night's sleep (fatigue affects responses)
- Eat normally (hunger affects mood and focus)
- Arrive on time (shows responsibility)
- Bring glasses if needed (need to read clearly)

**During Testing:**
- Follow instructions carefully
- Ask questions if instructions unclear
- Take breaks if allowed (long tests are tiring)
- Don't rush (accuracy matters more than speed)
- Stay focused (answer each question honestly, don't get distracted)

**After Testing:**
- Don't obsess over your answers (can't change them)
- Trust that your honest responses reflect your fitness as parent
- If results show elevation on scale (e.g., depression), discuss with attorney how to address in context (treatment compliance, doesn't affect parenting capacity)

**What If Results Are Bad:**

If test shows concerning elevations:
- Don't panic (one test doesn't decide custody)
- Get independent evaluation (your own psychologist to provide alternative interpretation)
- Emphasize treatment compliance (if you have diagnosed issue, you're managing it)
- Focus on functional parenting ability (test measures psychological symptoms, not parenting capacity - show through evidence that child thrives in your care despite your issues)
- Cross-examine evaluator's interpretation (some elevation normal, evaluator may over-interpret)

### Child Interview Preparation

**Evaluator Will Interview Child (If Old Enough):**
- Typically age 4+ (varies by evaluator)
- Without parents present (you won't be in room)
- Age-appropriate questions
- May be multiple sessions
- Often includes play-based assessment for young children

**What Evaluator Assesses:**
- Child's preference (if old enough, typically 12+)
- Parent-child relationships (which parent child closer to, why)
- Coaching (is child repeating parent's words)
- Alienation (does child parrot negative things about one parent)
- Safety concerns (any fear of either parent, abuse allegations)
- Daily routines (child's description of life at each home)
- Adjustment (how child is doing academically, socially, emotionally)

**Questions by Age:**

**Ages 4-7:**
- "Who do you live with?"
- "What do you do at Mommy's house? Daddy's house?"
- "Who helps you brush your teeth? Get dressed?"
- "What do you eat for breakfast?"
- "What's your favorite thing to do with Mom? With Dad?"
- "Who reads you stories at bedtime?"
- "Do you feel safe at both houses?"

Evaluator observes:
- Comfort level with each parent (affectionate, fearful, neutral)
- Child's language (own words vs coached phrases)
- Consistency with parent reports
- Signs of stress or anxiety

**Ages 8-11:**
- "Tell me about your daily routine at Mom's house. At Dad's house."
- "Who helps with homework?"
- "What's different about being at each house?"
- "What do you like about each parent?"
- "What do you wish was different?"
- "Do you ever feel scared at either house?"
- "Do your parents fight in front of you?"
- "Has anyone told you what to say to me?"

Evaluator observes:
- Specific examples (coached kids give vague or scripted answers)
- Balance (can child say positives about both parents, or all negative about one)
- Age-appropriate understanding
- Signs of loyalty conflicts

**Ages 12+:**
- All above questions plus:
- "Where would you prefer to live if you could choose?"
- "Why do you want to live there?"
- "How do you get along with each parent?"
- "What are each parent's rules?"
- "Do you feel like you can talk to each parent about problems?"
- "How do you think the custody schedule should work?"
- "What would make the custody situation better for you?"

Evaluator observes:
- Reasoning ability (can child articulate reasons, not just "I want to live with Mom")
- Manipulation (is child being manipulated by either parent)
- Maturity level (weight given to preference increases with maturity)
- Genuine vs coached preference

**Signs of Coaching Evaluators Look For:**

- **Scripted responses**: Too perfect, adult language, rehearsed delivery
- **Lack of specific examples**: "Dad is mean" but can't give examples
- **Repeating parent's phrases**: Using exact words parent uses about other parent
- **Contradictions**: Child's story doesn't match facts
- **Extreme loyalty**: No balance, all good about one parent, all bad about other
- **Parroting allegations**: Repeating serious allegations without understanding
- **Fear of disappointing parent**: Child checks responses, seems anxious about "right" answer
- **Inability to elaborate**: Scripted answer but can't expand when asked follow-up

**Example:**
Evaluator: "Tell me why you want to live with Mom."
Coached child: "Because Dad is neglectful and emotionally abusive." (Adult language, vague)
Evaluator: "Can you give me an example of that?"
Coached child: "Um... just, he is." (Can't provide specifics)

Genuine child: "I want to live with Mom because she helps with my homework every day, and I do better in school when I'm at her house. Dad is fun, but he doesn't have a routine and I like having a routine." (Specific, balanced, child's own reasoning)

**How to Prepare Child (Ethically, Not Coaching):**

**Do:**
- Tell child evaluator will ask about their life (be honest)
- Reassure child this is not their fault, they didn't do anything wrong
- Let child know they should tell truth about how they feel
- Reassure that you'll be okay no matter what child says
- Emphasize both parents love child
- If child asks what to say: "Just tell [evaluator] how you really feel. There's no right or wrong answer."

**Don't:**
- Tell child what to say ("Make sure you tell them you want to live with me")
- Rehearse responses ("If they ask about Dad, say...")
- Badmouth other parent before interview ("Tell them how Dad never helps with homework")
- Make child feel they must choose ("Do you love me or Dad more?")
- Grill child after interview ("What did you tell them?")
- Make child feel guilty ("If you say you want to live with Dad, you'll break my heart")
- Discuss adult issues (finances, legal strategy, evaluator's bias)

**After Interview:**
- Child may be tired or emotional (interview is stressful)
- Don't interrogate child about what was said
- If child volunteers information, listen supportively
- Don't react negatively to anything child says
- Reassure child they did fine, you're proud of them for being honest

### Collateral Contact Strategy

**Who Evaluator Will Interview:**
- Anyone either parent identifies as relevant
- Teachers, doctors, coaches, childcare providers
- Family members (yours and other parent's)
- Friends and neighbors
- Therapists (yours, child's, family)
- Anyone mentioned in pleadings or by either parent

**Preparing Your Collateral Contacts:**

**Step 1: Choose Wisely**
- People with relevant knowledge (direct observations of your parenting)
- Credible witnesses (stable, articulate, not overly biased)
- Professional contacts preferred (teachers, doctors) over family (seen as biased)
- Long-term relationships (known you for years, not just recent)

**Step 2: Ask Permission**
- "Evaluator may contact you as part of custody evaluation. Are you comfortable speaking with them about my parenting and [child]'s wellbeing?"

**Step 3: Brief Them (Without Coaching)**
- Provide context: "Contested custody case, evaluator assessing best interests of [child]"
- What evaluator will ask: Observations of your parenting, child's wellbeing, any concerns
- What to focus on: Specific examples (not generalizations), honest observations, child-focused perspective
- What not to say: Don't bash other parent excessively (looks bad), don't exaggerate, don't speculate beyond their knowledge

**Step 4: Key Points to Emphasize**
- Your involvement in child's life (attendance at events, communication, follow-through)
- Child's wellbeing in your care (happy, healthy, thriving)
- Specific examples (dates, incidents showing your engaged parenting)
- Professionalism (calm, appropriate, respectful in communications)

**Step 5: Provide Documentation**
- Any records they have (school reports, medical notes, team rosters)
- Contact information for evaluator
- Reminder to respond promptly if evaluator reaches out

**Sample Briefing Conversation:**

You: "Hi [Teacher], I wanted to let you know that as part of the custody case, a court-appointed evaluator may contact you to ask about [child]'s wellbeing and my involvement in [his/her] education. Are you comfortable speaking with them?"

Teacher: "Yes, of course."

You: "Thank you. They'll likely ask about my attendance at conferences, involvement in [child]'s education, and how [child] is doing. I'd appreciate if you could share your honest observations. Specific examples are helpful, like the times I've volunteered or our communications about [child]'s progress. You don't need to say anything negative about [other parent], just your observations of [child] and my involvement. "

Teacher: "No problem. I'll tell them what I've observed - you're very involved, and [child] is doing well."

You: "I appreciate it. The evaluator is [name] and may contact you in the next few weeks. Thank you for your time."

**What Good Collaterals Will Say:**

**Teacher:**
"[Parent] has been highly involved in [child]'s education. Attends all conferences, responds promptly to communications, volunteers in classroom, ensures homework completed. [Child] has improved/maintained strong performance this year. [Parent]'s involvement makes a difference. [Child] is well-cared for, prepared for school, thriving."

**Doctor:**
"[Parent] brings [child] to approximately X% of appointments, provides detailed information about symptoms, follows treatment recommendations. [Child] is up to date on vaccinations, receives regular preventive care, is healthy and well-cared for."

**Coach:**
"[Parent] enrolled [child], pays fees on time, provides transportation to X% of practices/games, attends events and is supportive. Volunteers as [team parent/helper]. [Child] has improved/performed well and benefits from consistent support."

**Neighbor:**
"I see [Parent] with [child] daily. They go to park, ride bikes, do activities together. [Parent] is patient and engaged with [child]. [Child] seems happy, well-adjusted, and safe. [Parent] is responsible and appropriate."

**Damage Control for Other Parent's Collaterals:**

If other parent provides hostile collaterals (their family members, friends):

**Strategy:**
- Acknowledge to evaluator ("Other parent's mother has strained relationship with me due to divorce conflict")
- Provide context (bias, lack of current knowledge, hearsay)
- Offer rebuttal collaterals with similar knowledge but less bias
- Don't obsess (evaluator knows family members are biased)
