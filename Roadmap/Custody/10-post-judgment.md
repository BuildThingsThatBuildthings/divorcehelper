## Section 10: Post-Judgment & Modifications

### Overview: Life After Judgment

**Final Judgment Entered:**
- Court issues final custody orders
- Divorce decree entered
- Custody arrangement permanent (unless modified)

**Your Responsibilities:**
- Implement custody orders exactly as written
- Facilitate other parent's relationship with child
- Continue focusing on child's best interests
- Document ongoing parenting and any concerns

**Other Parent's Responsibilities:**
- Same as yours
- May or may not comply (document if they don't)

**When Modification Possible:**
- Significant change in circumstances
- Time passage + child's needs change
- Other parent's violations of orders
- Child's preference (as child ages)

### Implementing Final Judgment

**Follow Orders Precisely:**
- Custody schedule exactly as ordered
- Holiday schedule as ordered
- Decision-making as ordered (legal custody provisions)
- Communication as ordered

**Why This Matters:**
- Contempt if you violate (could lose custody)
- Sets good example for other parent
- Shows respect for court process
- Protects you if future modification sought

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

**1. Informal Changes Without Court Approval**
- You and other parent agree to different schedule
- Not documented or court-approved
- One parent later claims violation of orders

**Solution:**
- Any changes to orders must be in writing (email or text)
- Or filed with court as modified order (stipulation and order)
- Don't rely on verbal agreements

**2. Blocking Other Parent's Custody Time (Even If You Disagree with Orders)**
- You don't like custody arrangement
- You withhold child from other parent
- = Contempt of court

**Solution:**
- Follow orders even if you disagree
- Seek modification through proper legal channels

**3. Making Unilateral Decisions (If Joint Legal Custody)**
- Joint legal custody = both parents must agree on major decisions
- You decide alone to change child's school, doctor, activities
- = Violation of orders

**Solution:**
- Attempt to reach agreement with other parent
- If can't agree, file motion for court to decide

### When to Seek Modification of Custody Orders

**Legal Standard:**
- "Significant change in circumstances" since last order
- Change affects child's best interests
- Burden of proof on parent seeking modification (you must prove change)

**Types of Changes That May Justify Modification:**

**1. Other Parent's Unfitness (New or Worsening)**
- Substance abuse (DUI, drug use, alcohol abuse)
- Mental health crisis (hospitalization, inability to care for child)
- Domestic violence (arrests, restraining orders)
- Child abuse or neglect
- Criminal behavior (arrests, incarceration)

**Example:**
Original orders: Joint physical custody (50/50).
Change: Other parent arrested for DUI with child in car.
Modification sought: Primary custody to you, supervised visitation for other parent.

**2. Your Circumstances Improved**
- You now have more stable housing
- You now have more flexible job
- You completed treatment/therapy (if issue before)
- Your new spouse provides additional support

**Example:**
Original orders: Other parent has primary custody because you traveled for work.
Change: You changed jobs, no longer travel, available for daily parenting.
Modification sought: Switch to primary custody with you.

**3. Child's Needs Changed**
- Child older, has preference (wants to live with you)
- Child's educational/medical/emotional needs better met by you
- Child's activities/friends/school in your area

**Example:**
Original orders: Joint custody, child alternating weeks.
Change: Child now in high school, all activities and friends near your home, child struggling with constant back-and-forth.
Modification sought: Primary custody to you during school year, more time with other parent in summer.

**4. Other Parent's Violation of Orders**
- Repeated violations (missed visits, late exchanges, withholding child)
- Contempt established (court found violations)
- Child harmed by violations

**Example:**
Original orders: You have visitation every other weekend.
Change: Other parent has denied you 15 of your last 20 weekends, no valid reasons.
Modification sought: Switch custody to you (if other parent can't follow orders, you should have custody).

**5. Relocation**
- One parent wants to move away with child
- Requires modification of custody/visitation

**(Discussed separately below)**

### Filing Motion for Modification

**Process:**

**1. Determine If Modification Justified**
- Review custody orders
- Identify significant change in circumstances
- Gather evidence proving change
- Assess whether child's best interests support modification

**2. File Motion to Modify Custody**
- Notice of Motion
- Declaration (sworn statement explaining change, providing evidence)
- Proposed modified order (what you want)
- Supporting evidence (exhibits)

**3. Serve Other Parent**
- Other parent has deadline to respond

**4. Hearing**
- Similar to temporary orders hearing
- Present evidence of changed circumstances
- Argue child's best interests require modification
- Other parent responds

**5. Judge Decides**
- Grants modification (orders change)
- Denies modification (orders remain the same)

**Burden of Proof:**
- You must prove:
  1. Significant change in circumstances since last order
  2. Modification in child's best interests

### Defending Against Modification (If Other Parent Seeks to Modify)

**If Other Parent Files Motion to Modify:**
- Review their allegations
- Prepare responsive declaration
- Gather evidence showing no change OR change not in child's best interests
- Attend hearing and argue against modification

**Common Arguments to Defend Status Quo:**

**1. No Significant Change**
- Circumstances are same as when original order entered
- Changes alleged are minor or temporary
- Other parent knew about alleged changes at time of original order

**2. Modification Not in Child's Best Interests**
- Child thriving under current arrangement
- Child bonded to both parents as is
- Stability important (changing custody disruptive)
- Other parent's proposed arrangement worse for child

**3. Other Parent's Motive Improper**
- Seeking modification to reduce child support
- Seeking modification to harass you
- Seeking modification for own convenience, not child's best interests

### Relocation (Move-Away) Cases

**Scenario:**
- You want to move to different city/state with child
- OR other parent wants to move with child
- Current custody orders don't allow relocation without other parent's consent or court approval

**Relocation Law (Varies by State):**

**California Example:**
- Parent with primary custody has presumptive right to move with child (but must give notice, other parent can object)
- Parent without primary custody needs other parent's consent or court approval to move with child
- If parents have joint physical custody, no presumptive right—court decides

**Move-Away Factors (What Court Considers):**
1. **Reason for move** (good faith? job opportunity, family support, educational opportunities vs. to frustrate other parent's relationship)
2. **Child's best interests** (will move benefit child?)
3. **Child's relationship with both parents** (how will move impact relationship with non-moving parent?)
4. **Child's age, developmental needs**
5. **Distance of move** (across town vs. across country—feasibility of maintaining relationship with non-moving parent)
6. **Non-moving parent's ability to maintain relationship** (visitation schedule after move, financial ability to travel)
7. **Child's preference** (if age-appropriate)

**If You Want to Move with Child:**

**Step 1: Notify Other Parent**
- Written notice (45-60 days advance, per your state's law)
- Reason for move
- New address
- Proposed revised custody schedule

**Step 2: Negotiate**
- Attempt to reach agreement on modified custody schedule
- May require:
  - Longer visits during school breaks for other parent
  - More frequent travel back to old area for visits
  - Technology for communication (FaceTime, Zoom)
  - You paying for child's travel costs

**Step 3: If No Agreement, File Motion**
- Request permission to relocate with child
- Propose modified custody schedule
- Evidence supporting move (job offer, family support, better schools, etc.)

**Step 4: Hearing**
- Present evidence why move in child's best interests
- Present evidence how you'll facilitate other parent's relationship despite distance
- Other parent will argue move harmful to child

**Step 5: Judge Decides**
- Grants move (can relocate with child, modified custody schedule)
- Denies move (can't relocate with child OR can relocate but child stays with other parent)

**If Other Parent Wants to Move with Child (You Object):**

**Your Arguments:**
- Move not in child's best interests
- Move will harm child's relationship with you
- Other parent's reason for move is illegitimate (to interfere with your relationship)
- Child's ties to current community (school, friends, activities)
- Your involvement in child's life will be drastically reduced

**Evidence to Present:**
- Your current involvement (how often you see child, your role in child's life)
- Child's ties to area (school performance, friendships, activities, extended family)
- Distance of move (feasibility of maintaining relationship)
- Other parent's motive (evidence move is designed to interfere with you)

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Court denies move (child stays in current area)
- Court allows move but switches custody to you (other parent can move, but child stays with you)
- Court allows move with modified schedule (you get longer visits during breaks)

### Contempt of Court (When Other Parent Violates Orders)

**What is Contempt?**
- Other parent's willful violation of court orders
- Can be civil or criminal contempt

**Examples of Contempt in Custody Cases:**
- Denying you court-ordered custody/visitation time
- Repeatedly late to exchanges
- Withholding child from you
- Making unilateral major decisions (if joint legal custody)
- Moving out of area without permission
- Violating no-disparagement orders (badmouthing you)
- Failing to pay child support

**When to Pursue Contempt:**
- Pattern of violations (not isolated incident)
- Violations harm child or your relationship with child
- Attempts to resolve informally fail
- Other parent shows no intent to comply

**Filing Contempt Motion:**

**1. Document Violations**
- Dates, times, specific orders violated
- Communications with other parent (your attempts to resolve)
- Evidence (texts, emails, witnesses)

**2. File Motion for Contempt**
- Notice of Motion
- Declaration (detailing violations)
- Evidence (exhibits)

**3. Hearing**
- Present evidence of violations
- Other parent must defend (deny violations OR show inability to comply wasn't willful)
- Judge decides if contempt occurred

**Consequences of Contempt:**
- **Makeup time** (you get additional custody time to make up for denied time)
- **Fines** (other parent pays court fines)
- **Sanctions** (other parent pays your attorney fees)
- **Modification** (if ongoing contempt, court may modify custody in your favor)
- **Jail** (in extreme cases, criminal contempt)

**Important:**
- Contempt requires proof that violation was willful (not due to emergency or inability)
- Example: Other parent late to exchange due to car accident = not contempt
- Example: Other parent late to exchange because they "forgot" = contempt

### Enforcement of Custody Orders

**Other Methods to Enforce Orders (Besides Contempt):**

**1. Police Enforcement**
- If other parent withholds child during your custody time, call police
- Bring copy of custody orders
- Police may enforce orders (depends on jurisdiction)
- Creates paper trail (police report)

**2. Order to Show Cause**
- Similar to contempt, but doesn't require proof of willful violation
- Other parent must "show cause" why they didn't follow orders

**3. Wage Garnishment (For Child Support Violations)**
- If other parent not paying support, request wage garnishment
- Support deducted from paycheck automatically

**4. License Suspension (For Child Support Violations)**
- Driver's license, professional license suspended until support paid

**5. Parenting Coordinator**
- Court-appointed neutral third party
- Helps enforce orders and resolve disputes
- Less formal than court

### Modifying Child Support

**When Child Support Can Be Modified:**
- Significant change in either parent's income
- Child's needs change
- Custody arrangement changes (more custody = less support paid)
- Passage of time (some states allow review every 2-3 years)

**Process:**
- File motion to modify support
- Provide updated income information
- Court recalculates support per state guidelines
- New support order issued

### Parenting Coordination (High-Conflict Cases)

**What is Parenting Coordinator?**
- Neutral third-party professional (often therapist or attorney)
- Appointed by court to help high-conflict parents implement custody orders
- Makes minor decisions when parents can't agree
- Educates parents on co-parenting

**When PC Appointed:**
- Frequent court filings over minor disputes
- Inability to co-parent (constant conflict)
- Child suffering due to parental conflict

**PC's Role:**
- Facilitate communication
- Resolve disputes (school choice, extracurricular activities, scheduling changes)
- Make recommendations to court (if issues escalate)
- Monitor compliance with orders

**Cost:**
- Parents split cost (typically $150-$300/hour)
- May be worth it to reduce legal fees and court filings

### Co-Parenting After Judgment (Making It Work)

**Even if you fought hard for custody and won, co-parenting still necessary:**
- Child benefits from relationship with both parents (in most cases)
- Ongoing conflict harms child
- Court expects cooperation

**Co-Parenting Best Practices:**

**1. Business-Like Communication**
- Brief, factual, child-focused
- Use email or parenting app (creates record)
- Don't engage in arguments or personal attacks

**Example:**
❌ Bad: "You're always late and the kids are upset. You're such a terrible parent!"
✅ Good: "Pickup was scheduled for 6pm today. You arrived at 6:45pm. Please adhere to the schedule in the future."

**2. Parallel Parenting (If Co-Parenting Not Possible)**
- Minimize direct contact
- Each parent makes decisions during their custody time
- Stick to court orders, don't negotiate everything
- Use third party for exchanges (school, relative)

**3. Focus on Child's Best Interests**
- Put aside your feelings about other parent
- Don't badmouth other parent to child
- Facilitate child's relationship with other parent
- Be flexible when possible (emergencies, special occasions)

**4. Document Issues (But Don't Overreact)**
- Keep records of violations, concerns
- Don't file motion over every minor issue
- Pick your battles (only involve court when necessary)

**5. Shield Child from Conflict**
- Don't fight in front of child
- Don't use child as messenger
- Don't interrogate child about other parent's house
- Don't ask child to choose sides

**6. Follow Orders**
- Even when you disagree
- Even when other parent doesn't
- Seek modification through proper channels if orders not working

### When to Return to Court (Post-Judgment)

**Return to Court When:**
- Significant change in circumstances (modification)
- Other parent's contempt (violations)
- Enforcement needed (other parent not following orders)
- New issues arise (relocation, child's needs change)

**Don't Return to Court for:**
- Minor disagreements
- Personality conflicts
- Every small violation
- Attempt to re-litigate issues already decided

**Court Fatigue:**
- Judges tire of frequent filers
- Damages your credibility (seen as high-conflict)
- Expensive
- Harmful to child

**Try to Resolve Outside Court:**
- Direct communication with other parent
- Mediation
- Parenting coordinator
- Collaborative problem-solving

**Only Court When Necessary:**
- Safety issues
- Repeated violations
- Significant changes requiring modification

### Long-Term Success: Thriving Post-Divorce

**For You:**
- Move forward with life
- Seek therapy if needed (divorce trauma, co-parenting stress)
- Build new routines with child
- Focus on your own wellbeing

**For Your Child:**
- Stability in your home
- Consistency in routine
- Emotional support through transition
- Shielded from ongoing conflict
- Thriving relationship with both parents (ideally)

**Years Later:**
- Child adjusts to two-home life
- Conflict reduces (most cases)
- You and other parent find workable co-parenting rhythm
- Child's needs evolve (be prepared to modify as needed)

**Remember:**
- Divorce is life event, not life sentence
- Child can thrive in two homes
- Your relationship with child is what matters most
- Focus on building strong, healthy parent-child bond
