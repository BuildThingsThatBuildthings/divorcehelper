## Section 9: Temporary Orders Strategy

### Overview: Why Temporary Orders Matter

**Critical Principle: Temporary Often Becomes Permanent**

**Statistics:**
- 70-80% of temporary custody arrangements become permanent
- Courts prefer stability and continuity for children
- "Status quo" presumption: Keep what's working

**Why This Matters:**
- If you get favorable temporary orders, you're likely to win at final judgment
- If other parent gets favorable temporary orders, you're fighting uphill battle

**Timeline:**
- Temporary orders hearing: 30-90 days after filing
- Final judgment: 6-18 months after filing
- Children live under temporary orders for 6-18 months = establishing "status quo"

**Your Strategy:**
- Fight hard for favorable temporary orders
- Treat temporary orders hearing like mini-trial
- Win temporary custody → likely win permanent custody

### Requesting Temporary Orders (Motion for Temporary Orders)

**When to File:**
- Immediately after filing divorce petition (or same day)
- Can file before response is due
- Urgent if current situation unstable or harmful to child

**What You Can Request:**

**1. Temporary Custody and Visitation**
- Primary physical custody to you
- Specified visitation schedule for other parent
- Decision-making authority (legal custody)

**2. Temporary Child Support**
- Based on state guidelines
- Ensures financial stability during divorce

**3. Temporary Spousal Support (If Applicable)**
- May be necessary to maintain status quo

**4. Exclusive Use of Family Home**
- You remain in home with children
- Other parent moves out (if not already separated)

**5. Restraining Orders (If Needed)**
- Domestic violence
- Child abuse
- Substance abuse around child

**6. Other Relief**
- No disparagement orders (neither parent badmouths other)
- Drug/alcohol testing
- Supervised visitation (if safety concerns)

### Motion for Temporary Orders: Components

**1. Notice of Motion**
- Tells court and other parent what you're asking for and when hearing is

**2. Declaration (Your Sworn Statement)**
- Facts supporting your requested orders
- Evidence attached as exhibits
- Detailed, specific, chronological

**3. Proposed Order**
- What you want judge to order
- Specific schedule, terms

**4. Supporting Evidence**
- Exhibits: Photos, texts, emails, logs, receipts, records
- Declarations from witnesses (teachers, family, neighbors)
- Prior orders (restraining orders, police reports)

### Writing Effective Declaration for Temporary Orders

**Structure:**

**Introduction:**
"I, [Your Name], declare as follows under penalty of perjury:

1. I am the Petitioner in this matter and the mother/father of [Child's Name], age [X]. I have personal knowledge of the facts stated in this declaration and, if called as a witness, could testify competently to them."

**Background:**
- Brief marriage/relationship history
- Child's name, age, current living situation
- Timeline of separation
- Current custody arrangement (formal or informal)

**Your Role as Parent:**
- Establish yourself as primary caregiver (or highly involved parent)
- Specific examples of daily caregiving
- School, medical, extracurricular involvement
- Financial support

**Why Temporary Orders Needed:**
- What's wrong with current situation
- How it harms child
- Urgency

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Child Currently with Other Parent (You Want Custody Back)**
"Since the separation on January 15, 2025, [Other Parent] has kept the children at his/her residence and is refusing to allow me regular contact. This is harmful to the children because:

a) I have been the children's primary caregiver since birth. Abruptly separating them from me is causing them distress.

b) [Other Parent]'s work schedule (8am-6pm, Monday-Friday) means the children are in childcare 50+ hours per week, whereas my flexible schedule allows me to be home with them after school.

c) The children's school, activities, and friends are all in my neighborhood. They are being uprooted from their established routine."

**Example 2: Current Arrangement Unstable (50/50 Informal, You Want Primary)**
"Since the separation, we have had an informal arrangement where the children alternate weeks between homes. This arrangement is not working:

a) The children are struggling with the constant back-and-forth. Emily has been asking to stay at my house full-time. Her teacher reports Emily seems more anxious this semester.

b) [Other Parent] has missed three scheduled custody exchanges in the past month, leaving me scrambling to arrange childcare.

c) There is no consistency in rules, bedtimes, or homework expectations between homes, which is confusing for the children."

**Example 3: Safety Concerns (Need Supervised Visitation)**
"I am requesting supervised visitation for [Other Parent] due to the following safety concerns:

a) On February 3, 2025, [Other Parent] was arrested for DUI with the children in the car. Police report attached as Exhibit A. The children were terrified. Jake has nightmares about the incident.

b) [Other Parent] has refused to complete substance abuse evaluation or treatment, despite my requests.

c) I do not believe it is safe for the children to be in [Other Parent]'s care unsupervised until [he/she] addresses the substance abuse issue."

**Other Parent's Fitness Concerns:**
- Specific, factual concerns
- Dates, details, evidence
- How concerns affect child

**Examples:**
- Substance abuse (dates witnessed, DUI arrests, children's reports)
- Mental health crisis (hospitalization, erratic behavior, children frightened)
- Domestic violence (police reports, restraining orders, children's trauma)
- Neglect (missed visits, failure to provide basic care, children reporting hunger/poor hygiene)
- Alienation (badmouthing you to children, blocking contact, coaching children)

**Your Proposed Custody Schedule:**
- Specific schedule you're requesting
- Why it's in child's best interests
- How it maintains stability

**Example:**
"I am requesting that the children reside primarily with me, with [Other Parent] having visitation every other weekend (Friday 6pm-Sunday 6pm) and one dinner visit per week (Wednesday 5pm-7pm). This schedule:

a) Maintains stability—children remain in family home, same school, same activities.
b) Provides [Other Parent] regular, consistent contact with children.
c) Aligns with my flexible work schedule, allowing me to be available for children after school."

**Facilitating Other Parent's Relationship:**
"Despite the issues outlined above, I want the children to have a relationship with [Other Parent]. I will facilitate all court-ordered visitation, communicate about the children's needs, and encourage the children's relationship with [Other Parent]."

**Conclusion:**
"For the reasons stated above, I respectfully request that the Court grant the relief requested in my Motion for Temporary Orders."

**Signature:**
"I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of [State] that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on [Date] at [City], [State].

### Responding to Other Parent's Motion for Temporary Orders

**If Other Parent Files First:**
- You will receive notice of their motion
- You have deadline to respond (usually 7-14 days before hearing)
- File responsive declaration

**Your Responsive Declaration:**

**Structure:**
- Respond point-by-point to other parent's allegations
- Provide your version of facts (with evidence)
- Counter their proposed custody arrangement
- Present your proposed custody arrangement

**Tone:**
- Factual, not emotional
- Acknowledge truths, correct mischaracterizations
- Don't ignore serious allegations (address them directly)

**Example Responses:**

**Other Parent's Allegation:**
"[Respondent] is never involved in the children's education. [He/she] has not attended a single parent-teacher conference this year."

**Your Response:**
"This is false. I have attended [X] of the [Y] parent-teacher conferences this year. I was unable to attend the conference on [Date] due to a work conflict, but I rescheduled for the following week and met with the teacher individually. Email confirmation attached as Exhibit 5. I also volunteer in the classroom monthly (sign-in logs attached as Exhibit 6) and communicate with the teacher regularly via email (examples attached as Exhibit 7)."

**Other Parent's Allegation:**
"[Respondent] has anger management issues and has yelled at the children on multiple occasions."

**Your Response:**
"I do not have anger management issues. Like all parents, I have occasionally raised my voice when the children engage in dangerous behavior (e.g., running into the street) or repeatedly ignore instructions. This is normal parenting, not abuse. I have never harmed the children physically or emotionally. [Petitioner]'s characterization is an exaggeration designed to make me look unfit."

**Other Parent's Allegation:**
"The children prefer to live with me. Emily told me she wants to live at my house."

**Your Response:**
"[Petitioner] appears to be coaching the children. Emily has never expressed to me that she wants to live primarily with [Petitioner]. In fact, Emily is bonded to me and looks forward to our time together. Childtherapist's report (attached as Exhibit 10) states that Emily has a secure attachment to both parents. [Petitioner]'s attempt to use Emily's words to support custody is inappropriate and potentially harmful to Emily."

### Temporary Orders Hearing Preparation

**Typical Hearing:**
- 15-45 minutes (much shorter than trial)
- Judge has read both declarations
- Each side gets brief argument time
- May allow brief testimony or questions
- Judge rules from bench (immediate decision)

**What to Bring:**
- Copies of all filed documents
- Extra evidence (if judge allows)
- Witness (if judge allows, unlikely)
- Notebook for notes

**What to Expect:**

**Judge Reads Declarations First:**
- Judge has reviewed your declaration and other parent's declaration
- Judge may have tentative ruling before hearing

**Your Attorney Argues (5-15 minutes):**
- Summarizes your position
- Highlights strongest evidence
- Requests specific orders

**Other Parent's Attorney Argues (5-15 minutes):**
- Summarizes their position
- Attacks your evidence
- Requests different orders

**Rebuttal (Brief):**
- Your attorney responds to other parent's arguments

**Judge May Ask Questions:**
- Of attorneys
- Of parties (you may be questioned directly)
- About specific facts or evidence

**Judge Rules:**
- Announces temporary custody arrangement
- Announces temporary support
- Other orders (if requested)

**Temporary Orders Issued:**
- Signed order entered within days
- Enforceable immediately
- In effect until final judgment

### If You Win Temporary Orders

**Implement Orders Precisely:**
- Follow custody schedule exactly
- Follow all conditions (no drinking around kids, drug testing, etc.)
- Facilitate other parent's visitation (don't block or interfere)
- Document compliance

**Why This Matters:**
- Establishes status quo
- Shows you can follow court orders
- Demonstrates child thriving under arrangement
- Builds case for permanent custody

**Maintain Temporary Arrangement Until Final Judgment:**
- Could be 6-18 months
- Continue documenting your parenting
- Continue gathering evidence
- Show child thriving

### If You Lose Temporary Orders

**Don't Panic—Not Over Yet:**
- Temporary orders are temporary (can be changed)
- Final judgment could be different
- But you have uphill battle (status quo working against you)

**Your Options:**

**1. Comply and Document (Most Important)**
- Follow temporary orders precisely (don't violate)
- Document all issues during other parent's custody time
- Document child's struggles under arrangement
- Build case for modification or different final judgment

**What to Document:**
- Child's distress (behavioral changes, school problems, emotional issues)
- Other parent's failures (missed visits, poor care, safety concerns)
- Your continued involvement (visits, communications, support)

**2. File Motion to Modify Temporary Orders (If Circumstances Change)**
- Significant change in circumstances required
- Examples: Other parent arrested, child being neglected, child's needs not met

**3. Proceed to Trial**
- Focus on building strongest case possible for final judgment
- Hope judge rules differently at trial (based on more evidence, different standard)

### Emergency Custody Orders (Ex Parte Orders)

**When Needed:**
- Immediate danger to child
- Can't wait for regular temporary orders hearing (30-90 days)

**Grounds for Emergency Orders:**
- Child abuse or neglect
- Domestic violence
- Substance abuse endangering child
- Parental kidnapping risk
- Other immediate threat to child's welfare

**Process:**

**1. File Ex Parte Motion (Emergency Motion)**
- Declaration explaining emergency
- Evidence supporting emergency
- Proposed emergency orders

**2. Hearing Scheduled (Usually Within 24-72 Hours)**
- Judge hears emergency motion
- Other parent may or may not be present (depending on jurisdiction and circumstances)

**3. Judge Issues Emergency Orders (If Justified)**
- Temporary custody to you
- Supervised visitation for other parent (or no contact)
- Restraining orders
- In effect until full temporary orders hearing (within 2-3 weeks)

**4. Full Temporary Orders Hearing Scheduled**
- Within 2-3 weeks
- Other parent has opportunity to respond
- Judge reconsiders emergency orders with full information

**Important:**
- Don't abuse ex parte process (false emergencies will backfire)
- Only use if genuine emergency
- Be prepared to prove emergency at full hearing

### Strategic Considerations for Temporary Orders

**1. Ask for More Than You Expect to Get**
- Negotiating room
- Judge may split the difference
- Example: Ask for primary custody (5 days/week), expect to get 4 days/week

**2. Propose Detailed Schedule**
- Don't leave ambiguity
- Specify exact days, times, holidays, exchanges
- Reduces future conflict

**Example Proposed Schedule:**
"Children reside primarily with [Parent A]. [Parent B] has the following parenting time:

- **Regular Schedule:** Every other weekend, Friday at 6pm through Sunday at 6pm; and every Wednesday from 5pm-7pm for dinner visit.

- **Holidays:** Alternate major holidays as follows:
  - Odd years: [Parent B] has Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve; [Parent A] has Christmas Day, New Year's
  - Even years: Reverse

- **Summer:** [Parent B] has two non-consecutive weeks in July and August, with 30 days advance notice.

- **Exchanges:** All exchanges at [location, e.g., children's school or neutral public location]."

**3. Request Orders That Set You Up for Success**
- Right of first refusal (if other parent needs childcare, must offer you time first)
- Communication protocol (email only, parenting app, etc.)
- Access to school/medical records and provider contact
- No negative communication about you to/around children

**4. Address Anticipated Issues**
- If other parent likely to violate orders, request violation consequences
- If substance abuse concern, request drug testing
- If alienation concern, request therapy for child and reunification therapy

**5. Be Reasonable (Judge Rewards Reasonableness)**
- Propose schedule that allows other parent relationship with child
- Show willingness to facilitate co-parenting
- Don't appear vindictive or controlling
