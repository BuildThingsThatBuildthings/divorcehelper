```

### Communication Records

**What to Preserve:**
- Text messages with other parent (especially showing their lack of involvement or problematic behavior)
- Emails with other parent (custody coordination, conflicts, refusal to cooperate)
- Communications with teachers, doctors, coaches (showing your involvement, other parent's lack of response)
- Social media posts (other parent's posts showing irresponsibility, lack of focus on child, inappropriate lifestyle)

**How to Organize:**
- Chronological order
- Categorized (co-parenting issues, child's education, child's health, alienation attempts, other parent's problems)
- Highlighted key phrases or admissions
- Context provided (what prompted the communication)

**What to Look For:**

**Your Communications (Showing You're Reasonable):**
- Child-focused messages
- Attempts to coordinate custody, activities, appointments
- Cooperative tone despite conflict
- Willingness to compromise for child's benefit

**Other Parent's Communications (Showing Problems):**
- Hostile, insulting, threatening language
- Refusal to cooperate on child-related matters
- Canceling parenting time frequently
- Not responding to messages about child's needs
- Badmouthing you in messages
- Admissions of problematic behavior (substance use, leaving child with inappropriate caretakers, etc.)

**Example:**
```
Text from you: "Emma's teacher asked us both to attend parent-teacher conference on Tuesday at 3pm. Can you make it? It's important."

Response from other parent (3 days later): "Whatever. You always handle that stuff anyway."

Analysis: Shows other parent's disengagement from child's education and unwillingness to co-parent.
```

**Third-Party Communications:**
```
Email from you to teacher: "Thank you for meeting with me yesterday to discuss Emma's progress in math. I've implemented the study techniques you suggested and I'm working with her for 30 minutes each night. Please let me know if you see improvement over the next few weeks."

Teacher response: "Thank you for your follow-through. I can already see Emma is more confident with the material. Your involvement makes a difference."

Analysis: Shows your proactive engagement with child's education and positive impact.
```

### Social Media Evidence

**Gathering Evidence on Other Parent:**

**Legal Methods Only:**
- Public social media posts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.)
- Screenshots of public posts (with date/time visible)
- Photos other parent posts publicly
- Check-ins, locations, tagged photos
- Friend's posts that tag or mention other parent

**What to Look For:**
- Partying, drinking, drug use
- Inappropriate relationships (dating many people quickly, bringing partners around child too soon)
- Disparaging posts about you or child
- Evidence of lies (claims to be at work but posts show at bar)
- Dangerous activities (extreme sports, reckless behavior)
- Neglect of child (posts about own activities during their custody time, no mention of child)
- Financial irresponsibility (luxury purchases, vacations while claiming inability to pay support)

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't hack into private accounts (illegal)
- Don't create fake profiles to "friend" other parent (potentially illegal, definitely unethical)
- Don't post your own inappropriate content (will be used against you)

**Your Own Social Media:**

**Rules for Your Posts:**
- Private accounts (friends/family only)
- No posts about divorce, custody battle, or other parent
- No posts about new romantic relationships (wait until custody resolved)
- No posts partying, drinking, or behavior that looks irresponsible
- Post positive parenting moments (child's achievements, family activities) - shows child-focused life
- Professional, appropriate content only

**Assume Everything Will Be Seen:**
- Other parent's attorney will request all social media in discovery
- Evaluator may review your social media
- Judge may see screenshots
- Post as if judge is watching (because they might be)
