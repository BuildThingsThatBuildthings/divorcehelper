## Section 6: Countering Other Parent's Tactics

### Defending Against Parental Alienation Allegations

**What Alienation Is:**
Systematic campaign by one parent to damage child's relationship with other parent through badmouthing, blocking contact, coaching, rewarding rejection of other parent.

**If You're Accused of Alienation:**

**False Allegation Strategy:**

**1. Understand the Accusation**
- What specifically are you accused of? (badmouthing, blocking calls, coaching)
- Is there any truth to it? (self-reflection critical)
- Why is other parent making this accusation? (to deflect from their own issues, gain custody advantage)

**2. Gather Counter-Evidence**

**Proving You Don't Alienate:**
- Communications showing you facilitate other parent's time (flexible with schedule changes, remind child to call other parent)
- Positive statements about other parent to collaterals ("I tell [child] that Dad loves them")
- Calendar showing you comply with custody orders (don't withhold time)
- Therapist statement (if child in therapy): "[Child] has positive relationship with both parents, no signs of alienation by [you]"
- Child's statements to evaluator (if child expresses preference for you, it's based on genuine reasons, not coaching)

**3. Reframe the Narrative**

Instead of:
"I'm not alienating!" (defensive)

Say:
"I actively support [child]'s relationship with [other parent]. I facilitate all scheduled parenting time, encourage phone calls, and speak positively about [other parent] to [child]. If [child] has expressed reluctance to spend time with [other parent], it's not due to my influence. I've encouraged [child] to maintain a healthy relationship with both of us. [Child]'s feelings may stem from [other parent]'s behavior during their time together, but I don't control that."

**4. Address Real Issues**

If child IS reluctant to spend time with other parent, explain why (without blaming):
- Other parent's home less stable (frequent moves, different partners, chaotic)
- Other parent's parenting style stressful for child (no routine, lax discipline, conflict)
- Other parent not engaged during their time (leaves child with others, doesn't interact meaningfully)

Provide evidence:
- Child's statements to therapist about reasons for reluctance
- Observations by collaterals
- Documentation of other parent's lifestyle or parenting deficiencies

**5. Offer Solutions**

Show you want child to have relationship with other parent:
- Propose family therapy to repair relationship
- Suggest parenting coordinator to improve co-parenting
- Offer to work with therapist on co-parenting strategies

**Red Flags That Suggest Real Alienation (Don't Do These):**
- Badmouthing other parent in front of child
- Blocking other parent's calls or refusing to facilitate communication
- Scheduling activities during other parent's time without consulting them
- Rewarding child for rejecting other parent
- Interrogating child after time with other parent
- Coaching child on what to say to evaluator
- Making child feel guilty for wanting to see other parent

**If You've Made Mistakes:**
- Acknowledge them to evaluator
- Explain what you've learned
- Show concrete changes (therapy, parenting classes, behavior modification)
- Emphasize current positive co-parenting efforts

### Defending Against False Abuse Allegations

**Types of False Allegations:**
- Domestic violence
- Child abuse (physical, emotional, sexual)
- Substance abuse
- Mental health issues making you unfit

**Why False Allegations Happen:**
- Gain custody advantage
- Get protective order removing you from home
- Delay proceedings (CPS investigation, psych evaluations)
- Retaliate for filing divorce

**General Defense Strategy:**

**1. Take All Allegations Seriously**
- Don't dismiss as "crazy" or "vindictive" (even if they are)
- Respond thoroughly and promptly
- Cooperate with investigations (CPS, police)
- Hire attorney immediately if you haven't already

**2. Document Everything**
- Timeline of your relationship with child (no abuse, loving relationship)
- Alibi evidence (if abuse allegedly occurred on specific date, where were you, who can verify)
- Communications showing allegation timed for custody advantage (filed right before hearing, after you filed for divorce, etc.)
- Other parent's history of false allegations or manipulative behavior

**3. Obtain Expert Evaluations**
- Custody evaluator assessment (no evidence of abuse)
- Child's therapist (if child already in therapy, therapist sees no signs of abuse)
- Your own psychologist (assesses you as non-abusive)

**4. Prove Pattern of False Allegations**
- Has other parent made similar allegations before (against you or others)
- Did other parent threaten to make allegations ("If you file for divorce, I'll say you abused [child]")
- Do allegations lack specificity or change over time (sign of fabrication)

**Domestic Violence Allegations:**

**If False:**

**Immediate Response:**
- File responsive declaration denying allegations
- Provide evidence disproving (no police reports from alleged incidents, no medical records, no witnesses)
- Show timing (filed to gain advantage in custody case)
- Character evidence (no history of violence, witnesses attest to your calm demeanor)

**Evidence to Gather:**
- Communications showing no violence (other parent never mentioned fear, abuse, or violence before filing)
- Photos of other parent's lack of injuries (if available)
- Witnesses who observed your relationship (family, friends who saw no violence)
- Your own clean record (no arrests, no complaints of violence)
- Therapist/counselor (if you've been in therapy, therapist can attest to no history of violence)

**Pattern Evidence:**
- Other parent has history of false allegations
- Timing suspicious (right before custody hearing)
- Allegations vague or changing (no specific dates, details change each telling)

**Request Criminal Investigation:**
- If allegations are false, request police investigate (clears your name)
- If other parent refuses to cooperate with police, suggests fabrication

**Child Abuse Allegations:**

**If False:**

**Most Serious Allegation:**
- CPS will investigate (cooperate fully)
- Police may investigate (don't talk to police without attorney)
- Court may suspend your custody pending investigation

**Immediate Response:**
- Deny allegations specifically (not just "it's false," but detail why)
- Provide alibi if abuse allegedly occurred on specific date
- Request forensic interview of child (trained interviewer can detect coaching)
- Request independent medical examination (if physical abuse alleged, exam will show no injuries)

**CPS Investigation:**
- Cooperate fully (but with attorney present)
- Provide evidence of appropriate parenting (home visit will show child safe)
- Provide references (family, friends, teachers, doctors who observe no abuse)
- Ask for substantiation determination (founded or unfounded)

**If CPS Unfounds Allegation:**
- Use this in court (CPS investigated and found no evidence)
- Request sanctions against other parent (false allegations are serious)

**Evidence to Gather:**
- Child's medical records (no evidence of injuries consistent with abuse)
- Child's behavior with you (affectionate, not fearful)
- Therapist observations (child shows no signs of abuse)
- Evaluator assessment (home visit, parent-child interaction shows no abuse)
- Witnesses (people who've observed you with child see no abuse)

**Child's Statements:**
- If child made statements about abuse, forensic interviewer will assess coaching
- Coached children show specific signs (scripted language, inability to provide details, contradictions)
- If child recants or statements inconsistent, evidence of coaching

**Sexual Abuse Allegations:**

**Most Serious of All:**
- Police will investigate (criminal matter)
- CPS will investigate
- Court may suspend all contact pending investigation
- Criminal charges possible

**Defense Strategy:**
- Hire criminal defense attorney immediately (separate from family law attorney)
- Do NOT talk to police without attorney
- Request forensic interview of child (expert can detect coaching)
- Request independent medical examination (if abuse occurred, physical evidence usually exists)
- Polygraph (if you're confident you'll pass, offer to take one)

**Evidence to Gather:**
- Alibi (where were you when abuse allegedly occurred)
- Lack of opportunity (child was never alone with you in circumstances alleged)
- Other parent's motive (custody battle, filed after you sought divorce)
- Pattern of false allegations
- Child's prior statements (if child never mentioned abuse before, suddenly does after custody battle starts)

**Expert Testimony:**
- Forensic interviewer (child's statements don't indicate genuine abuse)
- Medical expert (no physical evidence of abuse)
- Psychologist (evaluates you, finds no sexual deviance)

**If Allegations Proven False:**
- Request full custody (false abuse allegations are severe form of alienation)
- Request supervised visitation for other parent (to prevent further coaching)
- Request sanctions (other parent pays your legal fees, held in contempt)

**Substance Abuse Allegations:**

**If False:**

**Immediate Response:**
- Volunteer for testing (hair follicle test shows 90 days, proves sobriety)
- Provide employment records (no issues at work suggesting impairment)
- Obtain substance abuse evaluation (proves no problem)

**Evidence to Gather:**
- Negative test results (immediate testing, then random testing)
- Employer statement (no concerns about substance use)
- Evaluation from licensed professional (LCSW, psychologist) stating no substance abuse
- Witnesses who observe your sobriety

**If You Have Past Substance Use (But Currently Sober):**
- Acknowledge past honestly
- Provide timeline of sobriety (dates clean, recovery program)
- Testing to prove current sobriety
- Sponsor/therapist letter confirming recovery
- Attendance records (AA, NA meetings)
- Completion of treatment program (if applicable)

**Turn Tables:**
- Request other parent be tested (if allegations false, perhaps projecting their own use)
- If other parent refuses, suspicious (you volunteered, they won't - suggests you have nothing to hide)

**Mental Health Allegations:**

**If Falsely Claimed You're Unfit Due to Mental Health:**

**Response:**
- Acknowledge any mental health diagnosis honestly (stigma exists but diagnosis doesn't equal unfitness)
- Emphasize treatment compliance (medication, therapy)
- Obtain evaluation from psychologist (assesses parenting capacity despite diagnosis)
- Separate diagnosis from parenting ability

**Evidence:**
- Treatment records (compliant with therapy, medication)
- Therapist letter (diagnosis managed, doesn't affect parenting)
- Parental fitness evaluation (psychologist assesses you're fit to parent)
- Child's wellbeing (thriving in your care despite your diagnosis)
- Functional parenting (daily logs, collateral statements show capable parenting)

**Compare to Other Parent:**
- If other parent also has mental health issues (anxiety, depression common), point out
- If other parent NOT managing their issues (refuses treatment), contrast with your proactive management

**Example Response:**
"I have been diagnosed with [depression/anxiety/PTSD]. I take this seriously and am in active treatment with [therapist] and [psychiatrist]. I take [medication] as prescribed, attend therapy regularly, and my symptoms are well-managed. My diagnosis does not affect my ability to parent [child]. As shown by [evidence of child thriving], [child] is healthy, happy, and well-cared for in my care. [Evaluator/therapist] has assessed my parenting capacity and found no concerns. In contrast, [other parent] has [untreated issues, refuses treatment, etc.]."
