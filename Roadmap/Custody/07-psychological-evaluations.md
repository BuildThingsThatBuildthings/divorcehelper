## Section 7: Psychological Evaluations & Expert Requests

### When Psych Evals Are Ordered

**Common Reasons:**
- Allegations of mental health issues affecting parenting
- High conflict case requiring expert assessment

- Judge orders sua sponte (on their own)

**Types of Evaluations:**

**1. Custody Evaluation** (Full evaluation covering all best interests factors)
- Most common
- Includes interviews, home visits, testing, collateral contacts, child interviews
- Results in custody recommendation
- Cost: $5K-$20K typically (split between parents or court allocates)
- Timeline: 3-6 months

**2. Psychological Evaluation** (Focused on mental health/fitness)
- Assesses specific parent's mental health
- Psychological testing (MMPI-2, etc.)
- Clinical interview
- Results in fitness opinion (fit to parent or not)
- Cost: $2K-$5K per parent
- Timeline: 1-2 months

**3. Substance Abuse Evaluation**
- Assesses whether parent has substance abuse problem
- Interview, testing, records review
- Treatment recommendation if problem found
- Cost: $500-$2K
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks

**4. Domestic Violence Evaluation**
- Assesses risk of violence
- Includes testing (PCL-R if psychopathy suspected)
- Safety recommendations

**5. Parenting Capacity Evaluation**
- Assesses specific parent's ability to meet child's needs
- Observation of parent-child interaction
- Assessment of parenting knowledge and skills
- Cost: $2K-$5K
- Timeline: 1-2 months

### Your Rights During Evaluation

**What Evaluator CAN Do:**
- Interview you (2-4 hours typically)
- Visit your home (typically 1-2 hours)
- Interview your child (without you present)
- Administer psychological tests to you
- Interview collaterals you provide
- Interview collaterals other parent provides
- Review records (court filings, school records, medical records, police reports)
- Observe parent-child interaction

**What Evaluator CANNOT Do:**
- Force you to answer questions (but refusal looks bad)
- Release report to parties without court order (confidential until filed)
- Have ex parte (one-sided) communications with judge
- Make custody determination (only recommendation - judge decides)
- Testify beyond scope of evaluation (if appointed only for psych eval, can't opine on custody)

**Your Rights:**
- Attorney present during interviews (but unusual, may make you look uncooperative)
- Object to evaluator if biased (motion to disqualify, but needs strong showing)
- Provide evidence and collateral contacts
- Review evaluator's report (usually 10-30 days before hearing)
- Cross-examine evaluator at trial (if you disagree with report)
- Obtain independent evaluation (your own expert for rebuttal)

### Strategic Response to Eval Requests

**If Other Parent Requests Psych Eval of You:**

**Option 1: Agree (If You're Confident)**
- Shows you have nothing to hide
- Evaluator likely to find you fit
- Turns tables on other parent (request reciprocal evaluation of them)

**When to Agree:**
- You have no significant mental health issues
- Any issues you have are well-managed
- Child thriving in your care
- You'll do well on testing and interview

**Option 2: Agree with Conditions**
- Request reciprocal evaluation (other parent evaluated too)
- Request narrow scope (focus on specific issue, not full custody evaluation)
- Request qualified evaluator (forensic psychology specialty, custody experience)
- Request timeline (deadline for completion so no delay tactic)

**Example Response:**
"I have no objection to a psychological evaluation, provided [other parent] also undergoes reciprocal evaluation. I request the evaluation be limited to [specific issue raised] and completed within 60 days. I request the evaluator be a licensed psychologist with forensic psychology training and custody evaluation experience. I will cooperate fully with the evaluation."

**Option 3: Object (If Evaluation Not Relevant)**
- No allegations of mental health issues affecting parenting
- Evaluation request is delay tactic
- Child thriving, no fitness concerns
- Evaluation waste of money and time

**When to Object:**
- Other parent can't articulate specific concern (just fishing)
- No allegations of mental health issues
- Other parent using eval to delay and drain your resources
- Recent evaluation already completed (no basis for second one)

**Example Objection:**
"[Other parent]'s request for psychological evaluation is improper. There are no allegations of mental health issues affecting my parenting. [Child] is thriving in my care, as shown by [evidence]. This request appears to be a delay tactic to avoid trial. The request should be denied as irrelevant and wasteful of resources."

**Option 4: Agree to Substance Abuse Eval But Not Psych Eval**
- If allegation is substance use (not mental health), stipulate to narrow substance abuse evaluation only

**If Judge Orders Evaluation:**
- Comply fully (no choice)
- Prepare thoroughly (see Section 4 above)
- Provide evidence of fitness
- Use evaluation as opportunity to prove you're better parent

### Independent Evaluation (Your Own Expert)

**When to Get Independent Evaluation:**

**1. Court-Appointed Eval Negative**
- Evaluator recommended custody to other parent
- Report contains errors, bias, or incomplete investigation
- Need rebuttal expert for trial

**2. Proactive (Before Court Eval)**
- Want expert opinion supporting your custody position
- Can use as settlement leverage ("Expert evaluated me, recommends I have custody")

**3. Response to Allegations**
- Other parent alleges you're unfit due to mental health, substance use, etc.
- Get evaluation proving fitness

**How to Find Independent Evaluator:**
- Ask your attorney for referrals
- Search for forensic psychologists in your area
- Check credentials (PhD or PsyD, licensed, forensic experience, custody evaluations)
- Interview potential evaluators (will they be good witness at trial)

**Cost:**
- $5K-$15K typically
- You pay (not split with other parent)

**Process:**
- Similar to court-appointed evaluation (interview, testing, records review)
- Evaluator knows you hired them (may affect objectivity)
- Results in written report supporting your position

**Using Independent Evaluation:**

**Settlement:**
- Provide report to other parent during negotiations
- Leverage: "Expert evaluated me, recommends I have custody"

**Trial:**
- Your expert testifies
- Rebuts court-appointed evaluator's opinion
- Provides alternative analysis

**Weight at Trial:**
- Less weight than court-appointed evaluator (judge knows you paid them)
- But if credible expert with good credentials, can be persuasive
- Especially effective if court evaluator made errors (your expert points them out)
