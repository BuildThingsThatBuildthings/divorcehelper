## Final Tips

1. **Start TODAY** - Don't wait. Begin parenting logs and photo documentation immediately.

2. **Consistency Matters** - Daily logs for 2-3 months more powerful than sporadic entries over 12 months.

3. **Quality Over Quantity** - Organized, relevant evidence better than boxes of disorganized documents.

4. **Tell a Story** - Your evidence should paint clear picture: You're primary caregiver, child thrives in your care, other parent less involved or unfit.

5. **Work with Attorney** - Share this checklist with your attorney; they'll guide you on jurisdiction-specific requirements.

6. **Keep Gathering Evidence Throughout Case** - Continue documenting even after evaluation/trial (in case of appeals or future modifications).

7. **Protect Evidence** - Multiple backups (physical copies, digital cloud storage, USB drives).

8. **Stay Organized** - Use this checklist as your roadmap. Check off items as completed.
