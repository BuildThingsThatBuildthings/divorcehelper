## Section 8: Trial Preparation & Strategy

[Content continues... I'll add the remaining sections in the next update]

### Overview: Trial as Last Resort

**Trial Statistics:**
- Only 3-5% of custody cases go to trial
- Trials expensive ($25K-$100K+)
- Trials emotionally exhausting
- Outcome uncertain (judge's discretion)
- Timeline: 6-18 months from filing to trial
- Appeal difficult (high standard, more expense)

**When Trial Necessary:**
- Settlement negotiations fail
- Other parent unreasonable
- Significant fitness concerns about other parent
- Strong case that judge will award you custody

**Settlement vs Trial Decision Tree:**

**Settle If:**
- Outcome at trial uncertain
- Cost of trial outweighs benefit
- Child suffering from prolonged conflict
- Settlement close to what you'd likely get at trial
- Other parent willing to negotiate reasonably

**Go to Trial If:**
- Other parent unfit (abuse, neglect, substance abuse, mental health crisis)
- You have overwhelming evidence
- Other parent refusing reasonable settlement
- Child's safety at risk under proposed settlement
- You're confident judge will award you custody

### Your Trial Team

**Essential:**
- **Custody attorney** (experienced trial lawyer, not just family law)
- **Yourself** (key witness, must testify well)

**Recommended:**
- **Custody evaluator** (if report supports you)
- **Therapist** (child's therapist, if applicable)
- **Expert witnesses** (psychologists, vocational experts, parenting coordinators)
- **Lay witnesses** (teachers, doctors, family, friends)

**Attorney Selection Critical:**
- Experience trying custody cases (not just settling)
- Trial skills (opening, direct/cross examination, closing)
- Custody law expertise in your jurisdiction
- Rapport with local judges (knows judge's preferences)
- Strategic thinker (case theory, evidence presentation)

**Questions to Ask Potential Trial Attorney:**
- How many custody trials have you done?
- What's your win rate?
- Do you know the judge assigned to my case?
- What's your trial strategy for my case?
- What's your fee structure (flat fee vs hourly)?
- Who will actually try my case (you or associate)?

### Pretrial Preparation (8-12 Weeks Out)

**Week 12-10:**
- Finalize witness list (who will testify)
- Finalize exhibit list (what documents will be entered as evidence)
- Complete all discovery (no surprises at trial)
- Schedule depositions of other parent's key witnesses
- Meet with attorney to discuss trial strategy

**Week 9-7:**
- Organize all evidence (binders, chronological, labeled)
- Prepare direct examination outline (your testimony)
- Practice your testimony (with attorney)
- Brief all witnesses (what to expect, what to say)
- Review other parent's evidence (identify weaknesses)

**Week 6-4:**
- Attend final pretrial conference with judge
- Exchange witness/exhibit lists with other parent
- Resolve any motions in limine (exclude bad evidence)
- Confirm all witnesses available for trial dates
- Create trial notebook (exhibits, outlines, notes)

**Week 3-1:**
- Final witness prep (mock cross-examination)
- Final exhibit organization (numbered, tabbed, organized)
- Review direct examination outline (know your story)
- Mental/emotional preparation (stay calm, focused)
- Arrange childcare for trial week(s)

**Week of Trial:**
- Professional wardrobe ready
- Sleep well (trial exhausting)
- Arrive early each day
- Review testimony each evening
- Stay off social media (will be monitored)

### Your Testimony (Direct Examination)

**Preparation:**
- Review your testimony outline 50+ times
- Practice with attorney (mock examination)
- Anticipate cross-examination questions
- Know your evidence (logs, photos, receipts) cold

**Testimony Structure:**

**Part 1: Introduction & Background (15-20 minutes)**
- Your background (work, education, family)
- Marriage history (when married, when separated)
- Children (names, ages, personalities)
- Your role as parent (primary caregiver or involved parent)

**Example:**
Q: Please tell the court about your children.
A: We have two children. Emily is 8, she's in 3rd grade at Lincoln Elementary. She loves reading and gymnastics. She's a sweet, sensitive child who does best with routine and stability. Jake is 5, in kindergarten at the same school. He's energetic, loves trucks and building things, and is very social.

**Part 2: Daily Parenting (30-45 minutes)**
- Typical day with children (detailed, specific)
- Morning routine (wake up, breakfast, school prep)
- After-school routine (pickup, homework, activities)
- Evening routine (dinner, bath, bedtime)
- Weekends (activities, quality time, chores/errands with kids)

**Example:**
Q: Walk us through a typical school day with the children.
A: I wake them at 6:30am. I help Emily pick out her clothes—she likes to match her outfits. I help Jake get dressed since he's still learning. At 7am, I make breakfast. Emily likes oatmeal with berries, Jake prefers scrambled eggs. While they eat, I pack their lunches—sandwiches, fruit, vegetables, and a healthy snack. I supervise tooth-brushing and make sure they grab their backpacks. We leave at 7:45am. I walk them into school—Emily to her classroom, Jake to his. I speak with their teachers most mornings, checking in about assignments or behavior. After dropoff, I go to work...

[Continue with pickup, homework, dinner, bedtime—very detailed]

**Part 3: School Involvement (15-20 minutes)**
- Parent-teacher conferences (attendance, notes from conferences)
- Volunteering (classroom helper, field trip chaperone, PTA)
- Communication with teachers (emails, notes, problem-solving)
- Homework help (routine, what subjects, how you assist)
- Academic progress (grades, improvements, your role in supporting learning)

**Example:**
Q: Tell us about your involvement in Emily's education.
A: I attend every parent-teacher conference. Last semester, Emily's teacher Mrs. Johnson told me Emily was struggling with math. I arranged for extra practice at home. We do math worksheets together every evening for 20 minutes. Her grades have improved from C's to B's. I volunteer in the classroom once a month as reading helper. I also chaperoned the zoo field trip in October. I email Mrs. Johnson weekly to check on Emily's progress...

**Part 4: Medical Involvement (10-15 minutes)**
- Well-child checkups (who schedules, who attends)
- Sick visits (who takes child to doctor)
- Medications (who manages prescriptions, who administers)
- Specialist appointments (if applicable—dentist, orthodontist, therapist)
- Medical decisions (who researches, who makes final call)

**Example:**
Q: Who handles the children's medical care?
A: I schedule all their doctor appointments. Emily and Jake have the same pediatrician, Dr. Patel. I take them to their annual checkups—I took both in September. When Jake had an ear infection last month, I was the one who noticed he was tugging his ear and running a fever. I took him to urgent care, got the antibiotic prescription, and administered it twice daily for 10 days. Emily sees an allergist for her peanut allergy. I take her to those appointments every six months and manage her EpiPen—I keep one at home and one at school...

**Part 5: Extracurricular Involvement (10-15 minutes)**
- Activities each child participates in
- Who enrolled them, who pays
- Who transports to practices/games/lessons
- Who attends events
- Your involvement (coaching, volunteering, supporting)

**Example:**
Q: Tell us about the children's extracurricular activities.
A: Emily is in gymnastics at Metro Gymnastics. I enrolled her two years ago. I pay the $150 monthly tuition. She has practice Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5-6:30pm. I take her to every practice—I watch from the observation area. She has competitions once a month. I've attended every single one. I also help coordinate team snacks...

Jake is in soccer through the YMCA. I signed him up in August and paid the $200 fee. Practice is Saturdays at 9am. I take him, stay and watch, and usually bring snacks for the team. Games are Sunday mornings. I've attended every game...

**Part 6: Primary Caregiver Status (20-30 minutes)**
- Historical timeline (who did what since child's birth)
- Percentage breakdown (your involvement vs other parent's)
- Work schedules (yours flexible, theirs not)
- Specific examples (times you stepped up when other parent couldn't/wouldn't)
- Evidence supporting primary caregiver role (photos, receipts, communications)

**Example:**
Q: Would you describe yourself as the primary caregiver?
A: Yes, I have been since the children were born. When Emily was a baby, I took 6 months of parental leave. I did all nighttime feedings, all diaper changes, all doctor appointments. [Other parent] was working long hours and traveling frequently for work. This pattern continued as the children grew. I estimate I've handled 85-90% of the daily caregiving tasks—getting them ready, meals, bedtime, doctor appointments, school involvement, activity coordination. I have a more flexible work schedule, so I've always been the one to leave work early for sick kids, doctor appointments, school conferences...

**Part 7: Parenting Strengths (15-20 minutes)**
- What you do well as a parent (specific examples)
- Your parenting philosophy (how you discipline, teach values)
- Your bond with each child (attachment, special activities together)
- How children thrive in your care (evidence of wellbeing)

**Example:**
Q: What are your strengths as a parent?
A: I'm patient and consistent. Children need routine and predictability, and I provide that. They know the rules, they know what to expect each day, and they feel secure. I'm also very involved—I show up to everything. Emily knows I'll be at her gymnastics meets. Jake knows I'll be at his soccer games. That presence matters to children.

I'm also emotionally available. When Emily is upset, she comes to me. We talk through her feelings. I teach her how to identify emotions and cope with them. With Jake, he's still learning emotional regulation. I help him calm down when he's frustrated, and I teach him words for his feelings...

**Part 8: Other Parent's Fitness Concerns (20-30 minutes)**
- Specific, factual concerns (not emotional attacks)
- Examples with dates, details
- How concerns affect child
- What you've tried to address concerns

**CRITICAL: Frame as child-focused, not vindictive**

**Good Approach:**
- "I have concerns about [other parent]'s ability to meet Emily's needs because [specific examples]"
- "Jake has expressed to me that [specific thing], which concerns me"
- "I've tried to address this by [what you did], but [result]"

**Bad Approach:**
- "[Other parent] is a terrible parent"
- "[Other parent] doesn't love the kids"
- "[Other parent] only cares about themselves"

**Example (Good):**
Q: Do you have concerns about the children being in [other parent]'s care?
A: I have some concerns, yes. [Other parent] has struggled with alcohol use. In the past year, I've witnessed [him/her] intoxicated around the children on three occasions. On March 5th, when [other parent] dropped the kids off after visitation, [he/she] smelled strongly of alcohol and was slurring words. The children were upset. Jake told me "[Other parent] was acting funny." I documented this incident and reported it to my attorney.

I'm also concerned about [other parent]'s inconsistent parenting. [He/she] will go weeks without seeing the children, then suddenly want more time. Last month, [other parent] missed three scheduled visits—the kids were disappointed each time. This inconsistency is hard on them emotionally...

**Part 9: Your Proposed Custody Schedule (10 minutes)**
- What custody arrangement you're seeking (full, primary, specific schedule)
- Why this is in child's best interests
- How you'd facilitate other parent's relationship (shows you're not alienating)

**Example:**
Q: What custody arrangement are you seeking?
A: I'm requesting primary physical custody, with the children residing with me and having regular visitation with [other parent]. Specifically, I'm proposing [other parent] have the children every other weekend and one evening per week for dinner. I believe this is in the children's best interests because it maintains the stability and routine they're accustomed to. I've been their primary caregiver their entire lives. Their school, friends, activities are all in my neighborhood. Disrupting that would be harmful.

That said, I absolutely want the children to have a relationship with [other parent]. I will facilitate all visitation. I will communicate about the children's needs, activities, and important events. My goal is co-parenting that prioritizes the children's wellbeing...

**Part 10: Future Planning (5-10 minutes)**
- Your plans for children's future (stability, education, activities)
- How you'll support their development
- Your commitment to co-parenting (even if you don't agree with other parent)

**Total Direct Examination Time:** 2.5-4 hours (spread over 1-2 days)

### Cross-Examination (By Other Parent's Attorney)

**Purpose of Cross-Examination:**
- Undermine your credibility
- Highlight weaknesses or inconsistencies
- Get you to admit helpful facts for other parent
- Make you look bad (emotional, vindictive, uncooperative)

**Types of Cross-Examination Questions:**

**1. Leading Questions (Attorney Testifies, You Just Agree/Disagree)**
- "Isn't it true that you work 50 hours per week?" (Yes/No)
- "You've been diagnosed with depression, correct?" (Yes/No)
- "On March 5th, you sent a text calling [other parent] a 'deadbeat,' didn't you?" (Yes/No)

**Strategy:**
- Answer honestly, briefly
- Don't elaborate unless it helps you
- "Yes" or "No" usually sufficient

**2. Impeachment (Catching You in Contradictions)**
- Attorney compares your testimony to prior statements (deposition, declaration, text messages)
- If you said something different before, attorney highlights contradiction

**Example:**
Q: You testified that you do all the cooking for the children, correct?
A: Yes, most of it.
Q: But in your declaration filed last month, you stated "[Other parent] occasionally prepares meals for the children," didn't you?
A: Yes, occasionally.
Q: So not "all" the cooking—correct?
A: Correct, I do the vast majority, [other parent] occasionally cooks.

**Strategy:**
- Be consistent with prior statements
- If caught in contradiction, acknowledge and explain (don't double down on lie)

**3. Gotcha Questions (Designed to Make You Look Bad)**
- "Isn't it true you deny [other parent] access to the children whenever you're angry?"
- "You've told the children negative things about [other parent], haven't you?"
- "You're trying to erase [other parent] from the children's lives, aren't you?"

**Strategy:**
- Don't take the bait (stay calm)
- Answer truthfully and add context if needed

**Example:**
Q: You've called [other parent] names in front of the children, correct?
A: I may have expressed frustration in front of the children on occasion, but I don't badmouth [other parent] to them. I've told them that [other parent] and I have disagreements, which is normal for adults, but that we both love them.

**4. Questions About Your Weaknesses**
- Attorney focuses on any parenting mistakes, personal issues, or areas where other parent is stronger

**Example:**
Q: You were cited for speeding while the children were in the car, weren't you?
A: Yes, once, two years ago. I was going 10 miles over the speed limit. I paid the fine and have had no traffic violations since.

Q: You've struggled with anxiety, correct?
A: I was diagnosed with anxiety five years ago. I see a therapist monthly and take medication as prescribed. My anxiety is well-managed and doesn't affect my parenting. In fact, therapy has made me a better parent—I've learned healthy coping strategies that I teach the children.

**Cross-Examination Survival Rules:**

**1. Tell the Truth**
- Most important rule
- If caught lying, your entire case collapses
- Judge will not believe anything you say

**2. Listen to the Question**
- Don't answer the question you wish was asked
- Don't answer the question you think is coming next
- Answer the actual question asked

**3. Pause Before Answering**
- Gives your attorney time to object if needed
- Gives you time to formulate good answer
- Shows you're thoughtful, not reactive

**4. Keep Answers Short**
- Don't volunteer information
- Don't ramble or explain unless question asks for explanation
- Less you say, less ammunition for cross-examiner

**Good Answer:** "Yes" or "No, that's not accurate"
**Bad Answer:** Long explanation that opens new lines of attack

**5. Stay Calm**
- Cross-examiner may try to anger you, make you cry, fluster you
- Deep breaths
- Monotone, factual answers
- Don't argue with attorney

**6. Admit When You Don't Know or Don't Remember**
- "I don't recall" is acceptable answer
- Don't guess or make up answer
- If you don't know, say so

**7. Correct Mischaracterizations**
- If attorney misstates your testimony, politely correct
- "That's not what I said. What I said was..."

**8. Direct Answers to Judge (Not Attorney)**
- You're testifying to judge, not attorney
- Make eye contact with judge
- Judge is the one evaluating your credibility

**9. Don't Get Defensive**
- Defensive answers make you look guilty
- Calm, factual answers show confidence

**Bad Example:**
Q: You left the children alone in the car while you ran into the store, didn't you?
A: I was only gone for 2 minutes! It was safe! The car was locked! You're twisting everything I do!

**Good Example:**
Q: You left the children alone in the car while you ran into the store, didn't you?
A: On one occasion, I left the children in the car briefly while I returned a Redbox movie at the kiosk in front of the store. The children were buckled in their car seats, the car was locked, and I could see them the entire time. I was gone less than one minute.

**10. Your Attorney Will Rehabilitate You on Redirect**
- After cross-examination, your attorney gets to ask follow-up questions (redirect)
- Attorney will clarify any mischaracterizations, explain concerning answers
- Don't panic during cross—your attorney will fix it

### Other Parent's Cross-Examination (You're Not Testifying, But Watching)

**What to Watch For:**
- Contradictions (compared to their prior statements)
- Lack of specific knowledge about children (can't answer basic questions)
- Defensiveness or anger (shows poor emotional regulation)
- Blaming you for everything (shows lack of accountability)
- Inability to identify own weaknesses (shows lack of insight)
- Inconsistent answers

**Take Notes:**
- Write down anything you need to tell your attorney
- Don't react visibly (judge is watching you)
- Your attorney will use your notes for follow-up questions

### Witness Examination

**Your Witnesses (Direct Examination by Your Attorney):**

**Purpose:**
- Corroborate your testimony
- Provide independent perspective on your parenting
- Identify concerns about other parent (if applicable)

**Common Witnesses:**

**1. Teachers**
- Who attends conferences
- Who volunteers
- Who helps with homework
- Child's wellbeing (emotional, academic, social)

**Sample Questions:**
Q: How would you describe [parent]'s involvement in Emily's education?
A: [Parent] is one of the most involved parents I have. [He/she] attends every conference, emails me regularly, volunteers in the classroom, and clearly works with Emily on her homework. Emily's progress this year has been wonderful, and [parent]'s involvement is a big reason why.

**2. Doctors**
- Who brings child to appointments
- Who follows medical advice
- Child's health and wellbeing

**Sample Questions:**
Q: In your role as Emily's pediatrician, which parent typically brings her to appointments?
A: [Parent] brings Emily to approximately 90% of her appointments. [He/she] is attentive, asks good questions, and follows my recommendations for Emily's care.

**3. Therapist (Child's Therapist)**
- Child's emotional wellbeing
- Parent-child relationships
- Observations about each parent

**NOTE:** Therapist testimony can be problematic (confidentiality, dual relationship). Get attorney advice before calling child's therapist.

**4. Family/Friends**
- Long-term observations of your parenting
- Your relationship with children
- Concerns about other parent (if applicable)

**Sample Questions:**
Q: How often do you see [parent] and the children?
A: I see them almost weekly. They come to our house for Sunday dinners. I also babysit occasionally.

Q: How would you describe [parent]'s relationship with the children?
A: [Parent] is a wonderful parent. The children are happy, well-cared for, and clearly adore [him/her]. [Parent] is patient, engaged, and always puts the children first.

**5. Neighbors**
- Daily observations (who picks up kids from bus stop, who's home with kids, noise/fighting at other parent's house)
- Child's wellbeing
- Your involvement

**Other Parent's Witnesses (Cross-Examination by Your Attorney):**

**Purpose:**
- Undermine witness credibility (bias, lack of knowledge)
- Elicit helpful admissions
- Show witness doesn't have full picture

**Common Cross-Examination Topics:**
- Bias (witness is other parent's family member, close friend, financial interest)
- Limited knowledge (hasn't spent much time with children, doesn't know details)
- Hearsay (witness only knows what other parent told them, not personal observation)

**Example:**
Q: You're [other parent]'s mother, correct?
A: Yes.
Q: You want your son/daughter to have custody, don't you?
A: Of course.
Q: You only see the children every few months, correct?
A: Yes, I live out of state.
Q: So you don't observe the daily care the children receive from [my client], do you?
A: No, I suppose not.

### Expert Witnesses

**Types of Experts in Custody Trials:**

**1. Custody Evaluator (Most Important)**
- Court-appointed or privately retained
- Conducts comprehensive evaluation (interviews, testing, home visits, collaterals)
- Issues report with custody recommendation
- Testifies about evaluation and recommendation

**Direct Examination (If Evaluator Supports You):**
- Your attorney elicits evaluation process, findings, recommendation
- Evaluator explains why you should have custody
- Evaluator discusses concerns about other parent

**Cross-Examination (If Evaluator Supports You):**
- Other parent's attorney attacks evaluation methodology, bias, credentials
- Your attorney will prepare evaluator for cross

**Cross-Examination (If Evaluator Supports Other Parent):**
- Your attorney challenges evaluation (errors, incomplete, bias)
- Highlight facts evaluator missed or minimized
- Consider rebuttal expert

**2. Psychologist (If Psych Evals Done)**
- Testifies about evaluation results
- Explains diagnosis, treatment, parenting capacity
- Opines on fitness

**3. Vocational Expert (If Custody Dispute Involves Work Schedules)**
- Analyzes work schedules, flexibility, income potential
- Helps court understand each parent's availability for childcare

**4. Parenting Coordinator or Mediator (If Prior Involvement)**
- Testifies about co-parenting dynamics
- Identifies high-conflict issues
- May recommend custody arrangement

### Closing Arguments

**Purpose:**
- Summarize evidence presented
- Apply facts to law (best interests factors)
- Persuade judge to rule in your favor

**Structure:**

**Introduction:**
- "Your Honor, the evidence is clear: [Theme of your case]"
- Example: "The evidence is clear: Emily and Jake thrive in [my client]'s care because [he/she] has been their primary caregiver since birth, providing stability, consistency, and meeting all their needs."

**Summary of Evidence (Your Strengths):**
- List key evidence supporting your case
- "The court heard testimony that [parent] has attended every parent-teacher conference, every doctor appointment, every extracurricular event..."
- "The court reviewed the parenting logs showing [parent]'s consistent, daily involvement..."
- "The custody evaluator found that the children are bonded to [parent], thriving in [his/her] care, and recommended [custody arrangement]..."

**Best Interests Factors Analysis:**
- Go through your jurisdiction's best interests factors
- Apply facts to each factor

**Example (California Factors):**
"Under California Family Code Section 3011, the court must consider the best interests of the children. Let's examine the factors:

(a) Health, safety, and welfare of the child: The children are healthy, safe, and thriving in [parent]'s care. [Evidence: medical records, school records, testimony]

(b) History of abuse: There is no history of abuse by [parent]. In contrast, [other parent] has [allegations if applicable].

(c) Nature and amount of contact with both parents: The children have lived primarily with [parent] throughout their lives. This should continue to provide stability.

(d) Habitual or continual substance abuse: [Parent] does not abuse substances. [Other parent]'s alcohol use is documented and concerning.

Based on these factors, the only conclusion is that [custody arrangement] is in the children's best interests."

**Address Other Parent's Weaknesses:**
- Factually, not emotionally
- Tie to best interests

**Example:**
"The court heard testimony about [other parent]'s inconsistent involvement. [Other parent] missed three scheduled visits last month alone. This inconsistency is confusing and harmful to the children. They need a parent they can count on—that parent is [my client]."

**Address Your Weaknesses (If Other Parent Highlighted Them):**
- Acknowledge, contextualize, minimize

**Example:**
"[Other parent]'s attorney made much of [parent]'s speeding ticket from two years ago. Your Honor, this was a single minor traffic violation. It has no bearing on [parent]'s ability to care for the children safely. The children have been safe in [parent]'s care for their entire lives."

**Conclusion:**
- Restate your requested custody arrangement
- Emphasize children's best interests

**Example:**
"Your Honor, the law requires the court to prioritize the children's best interests. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that Emily and Jake are thriving in [parent]'s care, that [parent] has been and continues to be their primary caregiver, and that stability in [parent]'s home is essential to their wellbeing. We respectfully request that the court award primary physical custody to [parent], with reasonable visitation to [other parent]. Thank you."

### After Trial: Awaiting Decision

**Judge's Decision:**

**Option 1: Ruling from Bench (Immediate)**
- Judge announces decision at end of trial
- Less common in complex custody cases
- Judgment entered within days

**Option 2: Taking Under Submission (Delayed)**
- Judge needs time to review evidence, apply law
- May request written closing briefs (due 1-2 weeks after trial)
- Decision issued 2-8 weeks later
- More common

**Waiting Period:**
- Maintain status quo custody arrangement (temporary orders remain in effect)
- Continue documenting your parenting
- Don't discuss trial or case on social media
- Don't try to contact judge
- Continue co-parenting as best as possible

**When Decision Issued:**
- Attorney will receive notice
- Decision comes in form of "Statement of Decision" or "Findings and Order"
- Reviews facts, applies law, announces custody award
- Judgment entered based on decision

**If You Win:**
- Judgment entered awarding you custody per decision
- Implement new custody schedule
- Facilitate other parent's visitation
- Follow all court orders precisely

**If You Lose:**
- Accept judgment gracefully (for now)
- Implement custody schedule ordered
- Consider whether to appeal (discuss with attorney)
- Document other parent's failures (if considering future modification)

### Appeals (If You Lose)

**Appeal Basics:**
- Can appeal final judgment
- Must file Notice of Appeal within strict deadline (30-60 days, jurisdiction-specific)
- Expensive ($15K-$50K+)
- Time-consuming (6-18 months)
- Low success rate (appellate courts defer to trial court's judgment)

**Grounds for Appeal:**
- Legal error (judge misapplied law)
- Abuse of discretion (judge's decision not supported by evidence)
- Procedural error (violated due process, excluded important evidence)

**NOT Grounds for Appeal:**
- You disagree with judge's decision
- Judge weighed evidence differently than you'd prefer
- Judge found other parent more credible than you

**Standard of Review:**
- Appellate court reviews trial court's decision for errors
- Will not re-weigh evidence or re-hear testimony
- Highly deferential to trial court

**Appeal Decision:**
- Affirm trial court (you lose appeal, original judgment stands)
- Reverse trial court (you win appeal, judgment reversed, may be sent back for new trial)
- Modify trial court (judgment adjusted)

**Should You Appeal?**
- Consult with attorney (honest assessment of appeal chances)
- Consider cost vs benefit (another $30K for low chance of success?)
- Consider emotional toll on children (prolonging conflict)
- Consider relationship with other parent (appeal may destroy any co-parenting cooperation)
