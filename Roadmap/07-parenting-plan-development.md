# Stage 7: Parenting Plan Development (Months 3-12)

**Written by:** coparenting agent

---

## Overview

The parenting plan is the blueprint for your children's lives post-divorce. It governs where they live, when they see each parent, who makes major decisions, and how you will co-parent. Unlike property division (which ends when assets are divided), the parenting plan is a living document that will shape your family for years—potentially until your youngest child turns 18.

**Timeline Context:**
- Temporary parenting orders: Often established 30-90 days after filing (Stage 5)
- Parenting plan negotiation: Typically months 3-12 (parallel to financial discovery)
- Mediation: Most states require custody mediation before trial (4-8 hour sessions)
- Custody evaluation: If high conflict or allegations, court may order evaluation (3-6 months)
- Final parenting plan: Incorporated into judgment at settlement or trial

**What This Stage Achieves:**
- Detailed parenting schedule (regular, holidays, vacations, special occasions)
- Legal custody arrangement (decision-making authority)
- Physical custody arrangement (where children primarily reside)
- Communication protocols between parents
- Dispute resolution process
- Framework for future modifications as children's needs change

**Critical Principle:** The parenting plan must serve the children's best interests, not the parents' preferences. Courts prioritize stability, meaningful relationships with both parents (when safe), and minimizing exposure to conflict.

## Part A: Understanding Custody Concepts

### Legal Custody vs. Physical Custody

Most people use "custody" to mean where children live. Legally, custody has two components:

**Legal Custody (Decision-Making Authority):**
Legal custody is the right and responsibility to make major decisions about the children's upbringing:
- Education (school choice, special education services, tutoring)
- Non-emergency medical care (doctors, treatments, surgeries, therapy, medications)
- Religious upbringing (religious education, ceremonies, attendance)
- Extracurricular activities (sports, music, clubs)

**Types of Legal Custody:**
- **Joint Legal Custody (Most Common):** Both parents share decision-making authority. Major decisions require mutual agreement. If parents cannot agree, court decides or dispute resolution mechanism applies (mediation, arbitration, decision-maker appointed).
- **Sole Legal Custody (Rare):** One parent has exclusive authority to make major decisions. Granted when: One parent is absent, incapacitated, has history of violence, has abandoned children, or parents cannot communicate at all (even sole legal custody parent should consult other parent, but has final say).

**What Legal Custody Does NOT Control:**
- Day-to-day decisions during parenting time (bedtime, meals, activities, discipline while with that parent)
- Emergency medical decisions (parent with child at time can authorize emergency treatment)
- Minor decisions (haircut, clothing, age-appropriate entertainment)

**Physical Custody (Parenting Time/Visitation):**
Physical custody refers to where the children physically reside and when they are with each parent.

**Types of Physical Custody:**
- **Joint Physical Custody:** Children spend substantial time with both parents (not necessarily 50/50, but typically at least 35-40% with each parent). Focus is on meaningful time with both parents.
- **Primary Physical Custody:** Children reside primarily with one parent (60-80% of time); other parent has visitation/parenting time (20-40%).
- **Sole Physical Custody:** Children reside almost exclusively with one parent; other parent has limited visitation (e.g., supervised visits, brief weekend visits, or no contact if safety concern).

**Terminology Variations:**
- Some states (CA, TX, FL) have moved away from "custody" language to "parenting time" or "parenting plan" to reduce adversarial framing
- "Custodial parent" = parent with primary physical custody
- "Non-custodial parent" = parent with visitation
- Modern practice: Both are "parents with parenting time"; no "custodial" designation unless heavily unequal

### Best Interests of the Child Standard

Every state uses "best interests of the child" as the standard for custody decisions. Courts consider factors including:

**Child's Health, Safety, and Welfare (Primary):**
- Physical safety and protection from abuse or neglect
- Emotional and psychological well-being
- Access to medical care, therapy, educational support
- Stability in home environment

**Meaningful Relationship with Both Parents:**
- Strong preference for children to have ongoing relationship with both parents (when safe)
- Presumption in most states: Joint legal custody and frequent/continuing contact with both parents serves children's best interests
- Exception: Domestic violence, child abuse, neglect, substance abuse, or abandonment rebuts presumption

**Continuity and Stability:**
- Preference for maintaining status quo (established routine, school, community, sibling placement together)
- Minimizing disruption to children's lives
- Keeping siblings together (absent compelling reason to separate)

**Child's Age and Developmental Needs:**
- Infants/toddlers: Frequent, shorter visits with non-primary parent to maintain attachment
- School-age: Longer blocks of time, consideration of school schedules
- Teenagers: Greater weight to child's preference, peer relationships, extracurriculars

**Each Parent's Ability to Care for Child:**
- Physical and mental health (capable of meeting child's needs?)
- Parenting skills and history (who has been primary caregiver?)
- Work schedule and availability (can parent provide care or will child be with third parties?)
- Home environment (safe, clean, appropriate sleeping arrangements?)
- Support system (extended family, childcare resources)

**Each Parent's Willingness to Support Other Parent's Relationship with Child:**
- "Friendly parent" factor: Courts favor parent who fosters relationship with other parent
- Red flag: Parent who alienates, badmouths, or obstructs other parent's access
- Courts can reduce custody or even switch custody if alienation is severe

**History of Domestic Violence, Abuse, or Substance Use:**
- Rebuttable presumption against custody for perpetrator of domestic violence (CA, many states)
- Child abuse or neglect: Supervised visitation or no contact
- Substance abuse: May require sobriety testing, supervised visits, or treatment as condition
- Sexual abuse: Strong presumption against unsupervised contact

**Child's Preference (If Sufficiently Mature):**
- California: Child 14+ can address court directly (unless detrimental); younger child's preference considered based on maturity
- Other states: Age 12-14+ given significant weight
- Caveat: Court assesses whether preference is genuine or result of parental influence/alienation
- Never appropriate to ask child to "choose" parent in front of parents

**Geographic Proximity (Practical Consideration):**
- Can proposed schedule actually work given distance between homes?
- Does move-away by one parent serve children's best interests?
- Transportation burden on children (hours in car each day?)

**Other Factors:**
- Siblings' relationships and preference to stay together
- Special needs of child (medical, educational, emotional)
- Cultural and religious considerations
- History of caregiving (who did bedtime, homework, doctor appointments?)

**What Courts Do NOT Consider (or Give Little Weight):**
- Gender of parent (no preference for mother over father, or vice versa)
- Parent's new relationship or sexual orientation (unless directly impacts child's welfare)
- Economic resources (child support equalizes finances; wealthier parent doesn't get more custody for that reason alone)
- Who filed for divorce (irrelevant to parenting)

### Types of Parenting Plans

**50/50 (Equal Parenting Time):**
- **Schedule Examples:**
  - Week on/week off (alternating weeks)
  - 2-2-3 (Mon-Tue / Wed-Thu / Fri-Sun alternating)
  - 2-2-5-5 (Mon-Tue / Wed-Thu / Fri-Sun / Mon-Thu)
  - 3-4-4-3 (Half the week with each, alternating)
- **Best For:** Parents who live close (same school district), communicate well, have flexible schedules, children are school-age or older
- **Challenges:** Infants/toddlers may struggle with week-long separations; requires significant coordination; children always "visiting" somewhere
- **Legal Custody:** Almost always joint legal custody

**60/40 (Shared Parenting with Primary Parent):**
- **Schedule Examples:**
  - Every weekend Fri-Mon + 1 weeknight dinner (40% for non-primary)
  - Alternating 5 days / 2 days
  - Thursday overnight through Monday morning every other week + Wednesday overnight on off-weeks
- **Best For:** Parents who want shared parenting but children benefit from "home base"; one parent has more demanding work schedule; school-age children
- **Challenges:** "40%" parent may feel like visitor; coordination still required
- **Legal Custody:** Typically joint legal custody

**70/30 or 80/20 (Primary Custody with Regular Visitation):**
- **Schedule Examples:**
  - Every other weekend (Fri after school - Sun evening) + 1 weeknight dinner = ~20%
  - Every other weekend + Wednesday overnight = ~30%
  - First/third/fifth weekends + Thursday dinner = ~25%
- **Best For:** Parents who live far apart, history of one parent as primary caregiver, significant work/schedule constraints for one parent, young children attached to primary caregiver
- **Challenges:** Non-primary parent has limited meaningful time; children may lose closeness with that parent over time
- **Legal Custody:** Joint or sole legal custody depending on communication ability

**Supervised Visitation (Safety-Based):**
- **Schedule Examples:**
  - 2 hours every Saturday at supervised visitation center
  - Supervised by family member (grandparent) in their home
  - Therapeutic visitation (with therapist present)
- **When Ordered:** History of abuse, severe mental illness, substance abuse, child's fear of parent, return from long absence (reintroduction)
- **Path to Unsupervised:** Typically requires completion of treatment (batterer intervention, substance abuse program), therapy, demonstration of safe behavior
- **Legal Custody:** Almost always sole to other parent

**Long-Distance Parenting Plans:**
- **Schedule Examples:**
  - Extended summer vacation (4-8 weeks)
  - Alternating school breaks (Thanksgiving, winter, spring)
  - One weekend per month (child travels or parent travels)
  - Virtual visitation (video calls) as supplement
- **When Necessary:** Parent relocates for work; parents never lived in same area; military deployment
- **Transportation:** Typically split cost; parent who moved may bear more burden
- **Legal Custody:** Can be joint if parents communicate well by phone/video

### Age-Appropriate Schedules

**Infants (0-12 months):**
- **Primary Need:** Secure attachment to primary caregiver (usually breastfeeding parent initially)
- **Recommended:** Frequent (3-4x per week), short visits (2-4 hours) with non-primary parent
- **Avoid:** Overnight visits away from primary caregiver until 12-18 months (some courts more flexible if both parents equally involved from birth)
- **Goal:** Build attachment with both parents; maintain breastfeeding relationship if applicable
- **Transitions:** Non-primary parent comes to primary parent's home initially (familiar environment)

**Toddlers (1-3 years):**
- **Primary Need:** Consistency, routine, attachment to both parents
- **Recommended:** Gradually increasing time with non-primary parent; introduce overnights by 18-24 months (1-2 nights per week)
- **Avoid:** Week-long separations from either parent (too long for toddler sense of time)
- **Example Schedule:** Wed 4pm-Thu 8am + Fri 4pm-Sun 6pm (every week) = 40%
- **Transitions:** Calm handoffs; transition object (stuffed animal, blanket) for comfort

**Preschool (3-5 years):**
- **Primary Need:** Routine, age-appropriate activities, socialization, managing transitions
- **Recommended:** 2-4 day blocks (can handle up to 4 nights away from primary parent)
- **Example Schedule:** Thu after school - Mon to school (every other week) + Tue dinner = 40%
- **School Consideration:** Maintain consistency in preschool attendance
- **Transitions:** Child can understand "Mommy's days" and "Daddy's days" with visual calendar

**School-Age (6-12 years):**
- **Primary Need:** School stability, extracurriculars, peer relationships, involvement of both parents
- **Recommended:** Week on/week off OR 3-4 day blocks
- **Example Schedule:** Week on/week off with same school; 2-2-5-5 if different schools
- **Activities:** Coordinate so both parents attend sports, recitals, school events
- **Homework:** Both parents support homework completion during their parenting time
- **Transitions:** Child can manage transitions; brief text "arrived safely" helpful

**Teenagers (13-18 years):**
- **Primary Need:** Autonomy, peer relationships, consistency for school/activities, input into schedule
- **Recommended:** Flexible schedule respecting teen's activities and social life; more input from teen on schedule
- **Example Schedule:** Week on/week off; OR teen chooses extra nights with either parent as schedule allows
- **Reality Check:** Rigid schedules often fail with teens (want to stay at one home for party, friend sleepover, homework project)
- **Court Consideration:** Teen 14+ can often address court and express preference
- **Balance:** Maintain relationship with both parents while granting age-appropriate independence

## Part B: Building Your Parenting Plan

### Regular Parenting Schedule

Your parenting plan must specify the regular schedule in detail.

**Components:**
1. **Which parent has children on which days/nights**
2. **Exchange times and locations**
3. **Transportation responsibility**
4. **Remote communication during other parent's time**

**Drafting Tips:**
- Be extremely specific (not "Parent A has weekends" but "Parent A has children from Friday at 6:00 PM until Sunday at 6:00 PM on the first, third, and fifth weekends of each month")
- Define exchange location (parent's home, neutral location like school, public place if safety concern)
- Define who transports (pick-up parent, drop-off parent, or meet halfway)
- Account for school days vs. non-school days (schedule may differ during summer)

**Example 1: 50/50 Week On/Week Off**
```
Regular Schedule:
- The children shall alternate weeks with each parent.
- Mother's Week: Monday at 8:00 AM (from school) through the following Monday at 8:00 AM (to school)
- Father's Week: Monday at 8:00 AM (from school) through the following Monday at 8:00 AM (to school)
- Exchanges: Children shall be picked up from and dropped off at school. During school breaks when exchanges cannot occur at school, exchanges shall occur at 9:00 AM at Mother's residence (Father picks up to start his week; Mother picks up to start her week).
- Transportation: The parent beginning their week shall be responsible for transportation.
```

**Example 2: Every Other Weekend + Midweek**
```
Regular Schedule:
- Mother shall have primary physical custody.
- Father shall have parenting time as follows:
  - Every other weekend from Friday at 6:00 PM until Sunday at 6:00 PM (first and third weekends of each month, plus fifth weekends)
  - Every Wednesday from 4:00 PM until 8:00 PM (dinner visit)
- Exchange Location: Mother's residence
- Transportation: Father shall pick up and return children for all his parenting time.
```

**Summer Schedule (If Different from School Year):**
Many families modify the schedule during summer break:
- Longer blocks of time (children not in school daily, so can travel)
- Each parent gets 2 weeks of uninterrupted vacation time
- Remaining summer follows school-year schedule OR alternates weeks

**Example:**
```
Summer Schedule (June 15 - August 15):
- Each parent shall have two (2) non-consecutive weeks of uninterrupted vacation time with the children. Parent must provide 60 days' written notice of vacation dates. If both parents select overlapping dates, first notice prevails.
- Remaining summer weeks shall alternate between parents (same exchange days/times as school year).
```

### Holidays and Special Days

Holiday schedules typically override the regular schedule. Define holidays in advance to avoid conflict.

**Major Holidays to Address:**
- New Year's Eve/Day
- Martin Luther King Jr. Day (3-day weekend)
- Presidents' Day (3-day weekend)
- Spring Break
- Easter/Passover
- Memorial Day weekend
- July 4th
- Labor Day weekend
- Halloween
- Thanksgiving (typically 4-5 days)
- Winter Break (typically 2 weeks)
- Children's birthdays
- Mother's Day / Father's Day

**Holiday Allocation Methods:**

**Method 1: Alternating Years (Even/Odd)**
```
Holidays:
- Thanksgiving (Wednesday 6 PM - Sunday 6 PM): Mother in even years, Father in odd years
- Winter Break: First half (Dec 23 noon - Dec 30 noon) Mother in even years, Father in odd years; Second half (Dec 30 noon - Jan 6 at school) Father in even years, Mother in odd years
- Spring Break: Mother in even years, Father in odd years
- Easter: Mother in even years, Father in odd years
- July 4th: Mother in odd years, Father in even years
- Labor Day weekend: Mother in odd years, Father in even years
```

**Method 2: Fixed Assignment**
```
Holidays:
- Mother's Day weekend: Always with Mother (Sat 9 AM - Sun 6 PM)
- Father's Day weekend: Always with Father (Sat 9 AM - Sun 6 PM)
- Thanksgiving: Always with Mother
- Christmas Eve (Dec 24 noon - Dec 25 noon): Always with Mother
- Christmas Day (Dec 25 noon - Dec 26 noon): Always with Father
```

**Method 3: Split Each Holiday**
```
Winter Break:
- First half (first day of break through Dec 26 at noon): Mother in even years, Father in odd years
- Second half (Dec 26 noon through last day of break): Father in even years, Mother in odd years
- Switch each year
```

**Children's Birthdays:**
Options:
- Child spends birthday with parent whose regular schedule it falls on (no override)
- Parent whose schedule it's NOT gets 2-hour dinner visit on birthday (6-8 PM)
- Split birthday (afternoon with one parent, evening with other)
- Non-birthday parent gets makeup celebration on next available day

**Example:**
```
Children's Birthdays:
- The child shall spend their birthday with whichever parent has the child that day per the regular schedule.
- The other parent shall have the right to a 2-hour visit (6:00-8:00 PM) on the child's birthday to celebrate.
- Each parent may host a birthday party for the child during their parenting time. Both parents shall be invited to any party hosted by a third party (school, friend).
```

**Mother's Day and Father's Day:**
```
Mother's Day: Mother shall have the children from Saturday at 9:00 AM through Sunday at 6:00 PM, regardless of regular schedule.
Father's Day: Father shall have the children from Saturday at 9:00 AM through Sunday at 6:00 PM, regardless of regular schedule.
```

### Vacation and Travel

**Uninterrupted Vacation Time:**
Each parent should have opportunity to travel with children without interference.

**Typical Provision:**
```
Vacation:
- Each parent shall be entitled to two (2) weeks of uninterrupted vacation time with the children each year.
- Vacation weeks need not be consecutive.
- Vacation time may be taken during the other parent's regularly scheduled parenting time.
- Parent must provide written notice to other parent at least 60 days in advance, including dates and destination.
- If both parents select overlapping vacation dates, the first notice received shall prevail.
- During parent's vacation time, other parent's regular schedule is suspended and resumes after vacation ends.
- Parent taking vacation shall provide itinerary and contact information to other parent.
```

**Travel Restrictions:**
If concerns about safety, international travel, or parental abduction:

```
Travel Restrictions:
- Neither parent shall travel outside the United States with the children without written consent of the other parent or court order.
- If parent travels internationally with children, parent shall provide: (1) complete itinerary, (2) flight information, (3) hotel/lodging contact info, (4) telephone number where parent and children can be reached, (5) copy of children's passports.
- Passports shall be held by [Mother/Father/neutral third party] and shall be provided to traveling parent 48 hours before international travel, to be returned within 24 hours of return.
```

### Right of First Refusal

Right of first refusal means if one parent cannot care for the children during their scheduled parenting time, they must offer that time to the other parent before using a babysitter or third party.

**Purpose:** Maximizes children's time with parents rather than caregivers.

**Provision Example:**
```
Right of First Refusal:
- If either parent is unable to personally care for the children for a period exceeding [4 hours / 8 hours / overnight], that parent shall offer the other parent the opportunity to care for the children during that time before arranging alternate childcare.
- Offer shall be made by text or phone at least [24 hours / 4 hours] in advance if possible, or as soon as parent becomes aware.
- Other parent shall respond within [2 hours / 4 hours]. If no response, offering parent may arrange alternate care.
- Right of first refusal does not apply to: (1) time children are in school, daycare, or preschool; (2) babysitter for brief periods (less than 4 hours); (3) children are with grandparents or extended family as part of planned visit.
```

**Pros:**
- Children spend more time with parents, less with caregivers
- Both parents get extra time with children

**Cons:**
- Creates additional exchanges (instability if overused)
- Can be used as monitoring tool ("why do you need a babysitter?")
- Conflict over what counts as "unable to care for" (if parent is home but wants to attend event alone, must they offer?)

**Threshold:**
Many plans require absence of 4-8 hours before right of first refusal applies, to avoid constant offers for brief childcare.

### Decision-Making (Legal Custody)

If joint legal custody, specify how major decisions will be made and what happens if parents disagree.

**Decision-Making Provision:**
```
Legal Custody:
- Parents shall share joint legal custody and shall jointly make all major decisions regarding the children's education, health care, and religious upbringing.
- Each parent shall have access to all of the children's medical, dental, psychological, and educational records and shall be entitled to consult with medical and educational providers.
- In the event the parents cannot agree on a major decision, the parents shall attend mediation. If mediation is unsuccessful, either parent may apply to the court for an order.
```

**Alternative: Tiebreaker Provisions**
If parents have history of impasse, some plans assign final say on specific topics:
```
Decision-Making with Tiebreakers:
- Parents shall share joint legal custody.
- In the event parents cannot agree after good-faith discussion:
  - Educational decisions: Mother shall have final decision-making authority
  - Non-emergency medical decisions: Father shall have final decision-making authority

## Part D: Mediation and Custody Evaluation

### Child Custody Mediation

Most states require parents to attempt mediation before litigating custody.

**What Is Custody Mediation?**
- Neutral third-party mediator (often court-appointed, sometimes private) facilitates negotiation
- Focus: What parenting plan serves children's best interests?
- Confidential: Statements in mediation generally cannot be used in court
- Goal: Reach agreement on legal custody, physical custody, parenting schedule, holidays, decision-making

**Mediation Process:**
1. **Orientation:** Mediator explains process, confidentiality, ground rules
2. **Parent Statements:** Each parent describes desired parenting plan and concerns
3. **Issue Identification:** Mediator identifies areas of agreement and disagreement
4. **Child Focus:** Mediator redirects from parent conflict to children's needs
5. **Option Generation:** Brainstorm possible schedules and arrangements
6. **Negotiation:** Work toward compromise
7. **Agreement:** If successful, mediator drafts parenting plan for court approval

**Mediation Formats:**

**Court-Connected Mediation (Free or Low-Cost):**
- Required in CA, FL, and many states before custody hearing
- Brief (2-4 hours, sometimes multiple sessions)
- Mediator is often a family court services employee (social worker, counselor)
- If no agreement: Mediator may write report to judge with recommendations (CA: report only if parents agree; some states: mediator always reports)

**Private Mediation ($200-500/hour):**
- Can be more thorough (multiple sessions over weeks/months)
- Confidential (mediator does not report to court)
- Flexible scheduling
- May be better for high-conflict or complex cases

**Preparing for Mediation:**
1. Draft your ideal parenting plan (be specific: days, times, holidays)
2. Identify your priorities: What matters most? (e.g., 50/50 time, decision-making, maintaining stability)
3. Identify areas where you can compromise (e.g., willing to accept less than 50% if other parent agrees to joint legal custody)
4. Bring calendar, school schedules, work schedules
5. Focus on children's needs, not grievances against other parent
6. Be prepared to discuss: children's ages, temperament, special needs, history of caregiving, parents' availability, distance between homes

**What to Expect in Mediation:**
- Mediator is neutral (not your advocate, not judge)
- May meet with parents together or in separate rooms (shuttle mediation if high conflict)
- Mediator will challenge both parents and reality-test proposals ("How will this work given your work schedule?")
- You may leave frustrated, but agreement is better than trial
- If agreement reached: Reduced conflict, faster resolution, more control over outcome

**If Mediation Fails:**
- Case proceeds to custody hearing or trial
- Judge will decide parenting plan
- May order custody evaluation (see below)

### Child Custody Evaluation

**What Is a Custody Evaluation?**
A comprehensive investigation by a mental health professional (psychologist, LCSW) to assess both parents and children, and make recommendations to the court about custody.

**When Ordered:**
- Parents cannot agree and need expert assessment
- Serious allegations (abuse, neglect, substance abuse, mental health concerns)
- Child's preference conflicts with parent's request
- Complex family dynamics (parental alienation, special needs, relocation)

**Cost:**
- Court-appointed evaluator (rare, free or low cost)
- Private evaluator: $10,000-30,000+ (split between parents or allocated by court)

**Evaluation Process (3-6 Months):**

**1. Initial Interviews:**
- Evaluator meets separately with each parent (2-3 hours)
- Asks about: Parenting history, children's needs, allegations, proposed parenting plan, mental health history

**2. Child Interviews:**
- Evaluator meets with each child individually (age-appropriate)
- Asks about: Relationship with each parent, daily routine, feelings about custody, school/friends
- Assesses: Child's adjustment, preferences (if age-appropriate), signs of coaching or alienation

**3. Parent-Child Observations:**
- Evaluator observes each parent interacting with children (in home or office)
- Assesses: Attachment, attunement, parent's responsiveness, child's comfort level

**4. Home Visits:**
- Evaluator visits each parent's home
- Assesses: Safe, clean, appropriate sleeping arrangements, child-friendly

**5. Psychological Testing (Often):**
- MMPI (personality assessment)
- Parenting stress index
- Alcohol/drug screening
- Purpose: Assess mental health, parenting capacity, substance use, personality disorders

**6. Collateral Interviews:**
- Evaluator may interview: Therapists, teachers, doctors, grandparents, nannies
- Gathers outside perspective on parenting and children's adjustment

**7. Review of Records:**
- School records, medical records, therapy notes, police reports, CPS reports, court filings

**8. Written Report:**
- Detailed findings (20-50+ pages)
- Analysis of each parent's strengths and weaknesses
- Assessment of children's needs and preferences
- Recommendations: Legal custody, physical custody, parenting schedule, conditions (therapy, substance testing)
- Report submitted to court and attorneys

**9. Testimony:**
- Evaluator may testify at trial if either party challenges report
- Subject to cross-examination

**Preparing for Custody Evaluation:**

**Do:**
- Be honest (evaluator will verify information; lying destroys credibility)
- Focus on children's needs, not attacking other parent
- Demonstrate involvement in children's lives (attend school events, know teachers' names, know children's friends, medical history)
- Show stable, child-friendly home
- Be cooperative, punctual, respectful with evaluator
- Follow any court orders (no violations of temporary custody orders)
- If applicable: Complete treatment (anger management, substance abuse, therapy)

**Don't:**
- Badmouth other parent (shows inability to co-parent)
- Coach children (evaluator is trained to detect coaching)
- Be defensive or hostile
- Minimize concerns (if there are legitimate issues, address them directly)
- Appear entitled or inflexible
- Violate court orders during evaluation period

**Responding to Custody Evaluation Report:**
- If favorable: Submit to court without objection
- If unfavorable: Consider objecting, calling own expert to rebut, cross-examining evaluator at trial
- Reality check: Judges give substantial weight to evaluator recommendations (though not binding)

## Part E: Red Flags and Common Mistakes

### Parenting Red Flags That Reduce Custody

Courts watch for these behaviors when assessing best interests:

| Red Flag | Why It Matters | Court's Likely Response |
|----------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Parental Alienation** (badmouthing other parent, blocking contact, coaching children) | Damages children's relationship with other parent; shows inability to co-parent | Reduced custody; court-ordered therapy; custody switch if severe |
| **Withholding Information** (not sharing school/medical info, excluding other parent from events) | Violates joint legal custody; harmful to children | Court order for information sharing; sanctions; reduced decision-making authority |
| **Violating Court Orders** (not following temporary custody orders, denying parenting time) | Shows disrespect for court, unreliability | Contempt; makeup time for other parent; custody modification; jail in extreme cases |
| **Relocating Without Notice/Approval** | Disrupts stability; violates other parent's rights | Court orders return; move-away request denied; custody to non-moving parent |
| **Using Children as Messengers or Spies** ("Ask your dad if he paid child support") | Puts children in middle; emotional harm | Court criticism; family therapy; parenting classes |
| **Exposing Children to Adult Conflict** (arguing in front of kids, discussing court case) | Emotional harm to children; increased anxiety | Parenting classes; therapy; reduced custody if ongoing |
| **Introducing Children to Parade of Partners** | Instability; attachment concerns | Court may restrict overnight guests or require waiting period before introductions |
| **Neglecting Children's Basic Needs** (hygiene, medical care, homework, school attendance) | Failure to provide adequate care | Reduced custody; supervised visitation if severe |
| **Substance Abuse** (alcohol or drugs during parenting time or before driving children) | Safety risk | Supervised visitation; sobriety testing; treatment requirement; custody loss if ongoing |
| **Mental Health Crisis Without Treatment** (untreated severe depression, psychosis) | May impair ability to parent safely | Therapy requirement; temporary custody to other parent; reunification plan |
| **Parental Gatekeeping** (one parent believes they are "better" parent and restricts other's involvement) | Harms children's relationship with other parent | Reduced custody for gatekeeping parent; joint legal custody enforced |
| **Prioritizing New Partner Over Children** (canceling parenting time for dates, partner involved in discipline too soon) | Children feel abandoned; instability | Court criticism; custody modification if pattern continues |
| **False Allegations of Abuse** (making unfounded CPS reports, false DV claims) | Weaponizing system; harms children; alienation tactic | Sanctions; custody to accused parent if allegations proven false; perjury charges |

### Common Parenting Plan Mistakes

**1. Vague Schedule ("Parent A has weekends")**
- **Problem:** No clear exchange times, leads to conflict ("Does weekend start Friday or Saturday?")
- **Fix:** Be specific: "Father has children Friday 6 PM until Sunday 6 PM on the first and third weekends of each month"

**2. Not Addressing Holidays**
- **Problem:** Regular schedule doesn't clarify whether holidays override
- **Fix:** Explicitly state which holidays supersede regular schedule and allocate each holiday

**3. Unrealistic Schedule for Children's Age**
- **Problem:** Week-long exchanges for 18-month-old; requires infant to be away from primary caregiver too long
- **Fix:** Age-appropriate schedule (frequent, shorter visits for young children; longer blocks as children get older)

**4. Not Considering Transportation Burden**
- **Problem:** Schedule requires 2-hour drive each way multiple times per week; children exhausted
- **Fix:** Longer blocks of time to minimize exchanges; alternate transportation responsibility

**5. No Dispute Resolution Mechanism**
- **Problem:** Parents disagree on interpretation of plan; immediately file motions; legal fees escalate
- **Fix:** Require mediation before court filing

**6. Inflexible Schedule for Teenagers**
- **Problem:** 16-year-old required to follow rigid week-on/week-off despite social plans, part-time job, homework
- **Fix:** Build in flexibility: "Parents and teen shall mutually agree to modifications based on teen's activities and needs"

**7. Not Planning for Extracurriculars**
- **Problem:** Child enrolled in soccer that practices during both parents' time; conflict over who takes to practice, who pays
- **Fix:** "Both parents must agree before enrolling child in activity requiring participation during other parent's time or financial contribution from both parents"

**8. Confusing Right of First Refusal**
- **Problem:** Constant offers ("I'm going grocery shopping for 2 hours, do you want the kids?"); creates excessive exchanges
- **Fix:** Set reasonable threshold (4-8 hours) and exclude normal activities (school, brief errands, kids with grandparents)

**9. Using Parenting Plan to Control Other Parent**
- **Problem:** Provisions that micromanage (bedtime, food restrictions, screen time limits) during other parent's time
- **Fix:** Each parent has discretion for day-to-day decisions during their time (unless safety issue)

**10. Failure to Update as Children Grow**
- **Problem:** Plan created when child was 3; child is now 13; plan no longer appropriate
- **Fix:** Review and modify plan every 2-3 years or when children's needs change significantly

## Part F: What to Expect in Custody Litigation

### If You Cannot Settle

**Custody Litigation Timeline:**

**1. Temporary Custody Orders (Month 1-2):**
- Early hearing on temporary custody (until trial or settlement)
- Short hearing (15-30 minutes)
- Judge establishes status quo for duration of case
- See Stage 5: Temporary Orders

**2. Custody Mediation (Month 2-4):**
- Court-ordered or voluntary mediation
- Attempt to settle custody without trial
- If successful: Agreement becomes court order
- If unsuccessful: Proceed to evaluation or trial

**3. Custody Evaluation (If Ordered) (Month 4-10):**
- Comprehensive assessment by mental health professional
- Parents and children interviewed; testing; home visits; collateral contacts
- Written report with recommendations submitted to court

**4. Settlement Conferences (Month 6-12):**
- Judge or settlement attorney reviews case
- Strong encouragement to settle ("You don't want a stranger deciding how to raise your kids")
- Many cases settle on eve of trial

**5. Trial (Month 8-18):**
- If no settlement: Custody trial (half-day to multiple days depending on complexity)
- Both parents testify
- Witnesses may testify (therapists, teachers, family members)
- Custody evaluator testifies if report was done
- Judge asks questions, reviews evidence
- Judge issues "Statement of Decision" with custody orders

### Testifying at Custody Trial

**What Judge Wants to Hear:**
- Child-focused testimony: "I am requesting this schedule because it provides stability for my children and allows them to maintain a strong relationship with both me and their mother."
- Specific examples: "I help with homework every night, attend all parent-teacher conferences, and know the names of my children's teachers and friends."
- Co-parenting willingness: "I support the children's relationship with their father and believe joint legal custody is in their best interests."

**What Judge Does NOT Want to Hear:**
- Parent-focused testimony: "I deserve 50/50 because I have rights."
- Attacks on other parent: "She's a terrible mother because…" (unless directly relevant to safety)
- Vague generalizations: "I'm a good parent." (Be specific: what do you do?)
- Bitterness: "After all I've sacrificed…"

**Testimony Tips:**
- Stay calm, even under cross-examination
- Answer the question asked (don't volunteer extra information)
- Admit mistakes if asked ("Yes, I was late to two exchanges last month due to work; I've since adjusted my schedule")
- Don't exaggerate or lie (credibility is everything)
- Concede other parent's strengths ("He is a good father; we just disagree on the schedule")
- Focus on children's best interests, not your desires

**Cross-Examination:**
Other parent's attorney will try to make you look bad:
- "Isn't it true you were arrested for DUI in 2015?" → Answer honestly; explain if there's context ("Yes. I completed treatment and have been sober for 8 years.")
- "You don't even know your child's teacher's name, do you?" → If true, admit it and explain ("I know her name is Ms. Smith. I attend conferences but my ex handles most school communication.")
- "You left the children with a babysitter 3 times last month, didn't you?" → "Yes, for work obligations. I used our regular, trusted babysitter."

**Witnesses:**
You may call witnesses to support your case:
- Therapist (if child is in therapy; requires release)
- Teacher (school performance, attendance, involvement)
- Family member (your parenting, children's adjustment)
- Nanny/babysitter (observations of parenting)
- New partner (if relevant—usually not advisable unless long-term, stable relationship and can speak to your parenting)

**Evidence:**
- Calendar showing your involvement (school events, doctor appointments)
- Text messages showing other parent's alienation or violations of orders
- Photos of your home, children's rooms (if other parent claims unsafe environment)
- School records, medical records (showing your involvement)
- Therapy records (if supporting your position)

### Judge's Decision

After trial, judge will issue custody orders addressing:
- Legal custody (joint or sole)
- Physical custody (percentage, primary parent if applicable)
- Parenting schedule (specific days/times, exchanges)
- Holidays
- Decision-making procedures
- Any special conditions (therapy, substance testing, supervised visitation)

**Judge's orders are binding until modified by court.**

**If You Disagree with Judge's Orders:**
- Option 1: Comply and file motion to modify later (showing changed circumstances)
- Option 2: Appeal (rare, expensive, limited grounds; must show judge abused discretion)

## Checklist: Building Your Parenting Plan

### Before Drafting Parenting Plan
- [ ] Understand children's ages, developmental needs, temperament, special needs

## Summary: Key Takeaways

1. **Parenting plans have two components:** Legal custody (decision-making) and physical custody (parenting time). Most families have joint legal custody; physical custody varies (50/50, 60/40, primary with visitation).

2. **Best interests of the child is the standard.** Courts prioritize children's safety, stability, meaningful relationship with both parents, and minimizing conflict exposure.

3. **Age-appropriate schedules matter.** Infants need frequent, short visits with non-primary parent. School-age children can handle longer blocks. Teens need flexibility and input.

4. **Be specific in your parenting plan.** Vague schedules ("reasonable visitation") create conflict. Specify exact days, times, locations, transportation responsibility.

5. **Address holidays, vacations, and special occasions.** Allocate by even/odd year or fixed assignment. Each parent should have uninterrupted vacation time.

6. **Include decision-making and communication provisions.** How will major decisions be made? How often can each parent talk to children during other's time? How do parents communicate?

7. **Dispute resolution mechanisms reduce conflict.** Require mediation before court filing. Consider parenting coordinator for high-conflict cases.

8. **Avoid parental alienation behaviors.** Never badmouth other parent, block contact, or coach children. Courts severely punish alienation.

9. **Mediation is required in most states.** Prepare by drafting ideal plan, identifying priorities, and focusing on children's needs (not grievances).

10. **Custody evaluations are comprehensive and expensive.** Be honest, cooperative, and child-focused. Evaluator's recommendations carry significant weight.

**Final Thought:** The best parenting plan is one that both parents can live with and that serves your children's needs as they grow. Flexibility, communication, and a child-centered approach make co-parenting successful.
