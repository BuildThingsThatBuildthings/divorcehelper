## Core Settlement Principles

**Why Settlement Is Almost Always Better:**
- **Control:** You decide terms, not judge
- **Cost:** Mediation $2K-$10K vs. Trial $20K-$100K+
- **Time:** Settle in weeks/months vs. trial in 12-24 months
- **Privacy:** Confidential vs. public record
- **Relationship:** Preserve co-parenting relationship
- **Certainty:** Know outcome vs. unpredictable trial

**95% of divorces settle.** Even after extensive litigation, most settle on eve of trial.

## BATNA/WATNA Analysis

**BATNA = Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement**
- Your likely best outcome at trial
- Based on: Typical outcomes in your jurisdiction, facts of your case, consultation with attorney
- Discount by 10-20% for litigation uncertainty

**WATNA = Worst Alternative to Negotiated Agreement**
- Your likely worst outcome at trial
- Add: Litigation costs ($20K-$100K+)

**Settlement Range:**
Any offer between WATNA and BATNA is theoretically acceptable (better than risk of trial).

**Example:**
- BATNA: $500K (best trial outcome)
- WATNA: $300K (worst trial outcome including legal fees)
- Settlement range: $300K-$500K
- Offer of $450K: Acceptable (within range, good outcome)
- Offer of $280K: Reject (below WATNA—better to go to trial)
- Offer of $520K: Accept immediately (above BATNA)

**Intangible Value of Settlement:**
Even if offer is slightly below BATNA, settlement provides:
- Certainty (vs. trial uncertainty)
- Speed (resolve now vs. 12+ months)
- Reduced stress (no trial testimony/cross-examination)
- Relationship preservation (critical for co-parenting)

Consider accepting offers 5-10% below BATNA if intangible benefits are valuable to you.

## Package Proposals (Not Line-Item Haggling)

**Wrong Approach:**
- "I want $2,500 child support"
- "I'll offer $2,000"
- "Counter: $2,300"
- "Counter: $2,100"
- [Repeat for custody, property, spousal support separately]

**Problem:** Creates dozens of moving parts, impossible to evaluate total deal, leads to impasse.

**Right Approach (Package Proposals):**

**Package A (Your Preferred):**
- Custody: 60/40 (you primary)
- Child support: $2,400/month (guideline)
- Spousal support: $2,000/month for 6 years
- Property: You keep house ($300K), Spouse keeps 401k ($400K), Spouse pays $50K equalization
- **Total value to you: ~$550K**

**Package B (Middle Ground):**
- Custody: 55/45
- Child support: $2,100/month
- Spousal support: $1,500/month for 5 years
- Property: Sell house (you get $150K proceeds), divide 401k 50/50 ($200K each)
- **Total value to you: ~$470K**

**Benefits:**
- Spouse sees complete picture, can evaluate holistically
- Internally consistent (custody % affects support)
- Shows flexibility (2 options, willing to compromise)

---

## Interest-Based Negotiation

**Position vs. Interest:**
- Position = What you say you want ("I want the house")
- Interest = Why you want it ("Children's stability, can't afford moving costs, emotional attachment")

**How to Identify Interests:**
Ask "Why?" five times.
- "I want house" → Why? "Children's stability" → Why does stability matter? "Same school, friends nearby" → Could you achieve that without keeping house? "Maybe if I lived nearby"
- **Interest identified:** Children in same school district

**Creative Solution:**
You don't keep house, but settlement includes:
- You get enough cash to rent nearby (within same school district)
- Extra $30K moving costs/deposit
- Spouse agrees children stay in same school even if you move

**You gave up position ("keep house") but achieved interest ("children's stability").**

---

## Objective Anchors

Ground proposals in neutral standards, not "I deserve this."

**Types of Objective Anchors:**

**1. Guidelines:**
- Child support: State guideline calculator
- Spousal support: Temporary support formula (if your jurisdiction has one)
- Example: "Our proposal of $2,200 child support is based on CA guideline calculator [show printout]. Your offer of $1,500 is below guideline without justification."

**2. Appraisals/Valuations:**
- Home value: Professional appraisal
- Business: Expert valuation report
- Example: "Our appraisal shows house is worth $650K. Your claim of $500K is not supported. Let's use neutral appraiser."

**3. Case Law/Local Practice:**
- "In this county, judges award spousal support for half length of marriage for 10-15 year marriages. Our 12-year marriage supports 6 years support."

**4. Tax Calculations:**
- "If higher earner claims both children, we save $1,800/year in taxes. Propose: Higher earner claims both, pays $900/year extra support (splitting tax savings)."

**5. Comparable Sales (Real Estate, Vehicles, Business):**
- "Similar businesses in our industry sold for 3-4x annual revenue. Our business revenue is $800K, valuation of $2.5M is reasonable."

## Common Trade-Offs

| You Give Up | You Get | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Custody time** (accept 50/50 instead of 60/40) | **Lower support** (pay less if closer to equal time) | "I'll agree to 52/48 custody (close to your 50/50) if child support reduced to $1,800/month (vs. $2,400 guideline for 40% time)" |
| **House** (let spouse keep it) | **Higher support OR more retirement funds** | "You keep house, I keep full 401k + you pay $2,200 spousal support for 6 years" |
| **Higher support amount** | **Shorter duration** | "I'll pay $2,500/month (vs. my offer of $2,000) if duration is 4 years instead of 6" |
| **Lump sum now** (equalization payment) | **No monthly support** | "I'll pay you $100K lump sum now, you waive all spousal support" |
| **Decision-making authority** (ex gets tiebreaker) | **More parenting time** | "You get tiebreaker on education decisions if I get 55/45 custody (instead of 50/50)" |

**Key:** Trade your lower-priority item for your higher-priority item.

## Mediation Strategies

**Preparation:**
- [ ] Calculate BATNA/WATNA
- [ ] Draft 2-3 package proposals
- [ ] Identify top 3 priorities (yours and spouse's likely priorities)
- [ ] Gather documents (disclosures, appraisals, guideline printouts)
- [ ] Determine walk-away number (below WATNA = walk)

**Day-Of Strategy:**

**Opening Statement (Joint Session):**
- Constructive tone: "I'm here to reach fair resolution"
- Brief summary of your position (3-5 minutes, factual, not argumentative)
- Express willingness to compromise

**In Caucus (Private Session with Mediator):**
- Be candid (mediator is confidential—tell them your real priorities, concerns, bottom line)
- Ask for reality check: "Am I being unreasonable on custody?"
- Listen when mediator challenges you (they have experience—if they say your position is weak, take it seriously)
- Authorize selective disclosures: "You can tell him I'd consider 52/48 custody if he agrees I keep house"

**Negotiation Phase:**
- **Principled concessions:** Explain why you're moving ("I recalculated budget, can accept $2,400 if I downsize apartment")
- **Trade, don't concede:** "I'll agree to 50/50 custody if you agree to 3 extra weeks summer vacation for me"
- **Use objective standards:** "Guideline is $2,200; I'm offering $2,000 which is already below guideline. What's your objective basis for $1,500?"
- **Take breaks:** If overwhelmed, ask for 15 minutes to think
- **Beware sunk cost fallacy:** Don't settle just because you've been there 8 hours. If deal is below WATNA, walk away.

**Agreement:**
- Mediator drafts Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
- Review carefully before signing
- Ask questions if anything unclear
- Once signed, typically binding

## Settlement Structures

**Lump-Sum Alimony:**
- One-time payment instead of monthly support
- **Pros (Payor):** Clean break, no ongoing obligation, no modification risk
- **Pros (Recipient):** Certainty, can invest lump sum, no collection risk
- **Tax:** If structured as property division (not alimony), tax-free to recipient
- **Discount for present value:** $100K now worth more than $2,000/month for 50 months (time value of money)

**Step-Down Support:**
- Support reduces over time on schedule
- Example: $3,000/month for 2 years, $2,000/month for 2 years, $1,000/month for 2 years, then terminates
- **Reflects:** Recipient's increasing earning capacity over time

**Non-Modifiable Support:**
- Agreement that support amount cannot be changed (terminates on remarriage/death, but can't be modified)
- **Pros (Payor):** Certainty (if income increases, won't be asked for more)
- **Pros (Recipient):** Security (if payor's income drops, won't be reduced)

**Offset Property for Support:**
- Reduce monthly support in exchange for larger property share
- Example: Husband waives alimony claim, Wife agrees to 55/45 property split (instead of 50/50)

**Deferred Sale of Home:**
- Delay sale until future event (child graduates high school, 5 years, remarriage)
- One spouse lives there, both on title/mortgage
- **Pros:** Children's stability
- **Cons:** Both tied to asset for years

## Evaluating Offers

**Calculate Total Value:**

**Example Offer:**
- Custody: 50/50
- Child support: $1,200/month x 8 years
- Spousal support: $1,800/month x 5 years
- Property: You receive $300K (cash + retirement)

**Total Value Calculation:**
- Property: $300K
- Child support PV: ~$105K (present value, discounted)
- Spousal support PV: ~$95K (present value, discounted)
- **Total: ~$500K**

**Compare to Your BATNA ($520K) and WATNA ($350K):**
- Offer ($500K) is $20K below BATNA but $150K above WATNA
- **Conclusion:** Acceptable range. Consider intangible benefits (certainty, timing, relationship). Likely a good deal unless the specific custody arrangement is unacceptable to you.

## Red Flags in Offers

**Vague Terms:**
- "Husband shall pay reasonable support"—What amount? How long?
- **Fix:** "Husband shall pay $2,000/month for 5 years, terminating [date] or upon Wife's remarriage or either party's death, whichever occurs first."

**Unenforceable:**
- "Husband shall not speak negatively about Wife"
- **Problem:** How do you prove? How do you enforce?
- **Fix:** Remove or tie to consequence: "Either party engaging in parental alienation may be ordered to therapy at that party's expense"

**Unrealistic Timelines:**
- "Refinance mortgage within 15 days"
- **Problem:** Impossible—refinance takes 45-60 days
- **Fix:** "90 days to refinance; if unable, house listed for sale"

**Missing Contingencies:**
- "Wife keeps house, refinances"—What if she can't qualify?
- **Fix:** "If Wife unable to refinance within 90 days, house sold and proceeds divided 50/50"

**Tax Traps:**
- "Wife transfers $100K from IRA to Husband"—Without specifying direct transfer, could trigger taxes
- **Fix:** "Via direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to avoid tax consequences"

---

## Counter-Proposal Strategies

**If Offer Is Close But Not Quite:**

**Step 1: Identify Specific Problems**
- "Support is too low" or "I need 55/45 custody, not 50/50"

**Step 2: Calculate Your Counter**
- Offer: $480K total value
- Your BATNA: $520K
- Counter: $505K (split difference, show compromise)

**Step 3: Justify with Objective Standard**
- "Your offer of $1,500 child support is below $2,200 guideline. I'll accept $1,900 (still below guideline but fairer)."

**Step 4: Offer Trade**
- "I'll accept 50/50 custody (your priority) if you increase spousal support to $2,000/month for 5 years (my priority)"

## When to Walk Away

**Walk Away If:**
- Offer is below your WATNA (trial can't be worse)
- Spouse negotiating in bad faith (using mediation to delay, harass, not make real offers)
- You're being pressured to sign ("It's midnight, just agree!")—when you need time to think
- Safety concerns (intimidation during mediation)

**Don't Walk Away Just Because:**
- You're tired or frustrated (take break, resume later)
- Offer is less than you wanted (if it's above WATNA and provides settlement benefits, consider seriously)
- You don't like spouse's attitude (irrelevant to whether deal is fair)

---

## Making Settlement vs. Trial Decision

**Settle If:**
- Offer between WATNA and BATNA (even if not perfect)
- Co-parenting relationship matters (settlement preserves it)
- You value certainty, privacy, speed
- Trial costs would erode your award

**Go to Trial If:**
- Offer below WATNA (trial can't be worse, even accounting for costs)
- Spouse bad faith (trial is only option)
- Hidden assets requiring subpoena power
- Legal principle at stake (need judicial finding to protect rights)

**Risk Assessment:**
Trial is expensive, unpredictable, stressful, and public. Only choose trial if:
1. Settlement offer is truly unfair (below WATNA), OR
2. Necessary to protect rights (safety, hidden assets, principle)

**Most cases:** Settlement is better. Even imperfect settlement beats trial uncertainty.
