# Stage 9: Support Determination (Months 6-18)

**Written by:** financial-forensics + tax-benefits agents

---

## Overview

Support determination converts income disparities into monthly obligations. Child support ensures children maintain their standard of living; spousal support (alimony) addresses economic imbalances created by marriage. Unlike property division (one-time split), support is an ongoing financial relationship that can last years—sometimes decades. Understanding guideline calculations, income determination, tax treatment, and modification rules is essential to negotiating or litigating fair support orders.

**Timeline Context:**
- Temporary support: Established within 30-90 days of filing (Stage 5: Temporary Orders)
- Permanent support: Determined months 6-18 (parallel to property division and custody)
- Calculations require: Complete financial disclosures (Stage 6), custody determination (Stage 7)
- Support incorporated into judgment at settlement or trial

**What This Stage Achieves:**
- Child support calculation based on guideline formula (income + timeshare)
- Spousal support amount and duration (if applicable)
- Tax treatment clarification (especially post-2018 alimony changes)
- Allocation of dependency exemptions and tax credits
- Security for support (life insurance, wage assignment)
- Termination and modification conditions

**Critical Principle:** Support is about children's needs and spousal economic justice, not punishment or reward. Courts follow guideline formulas for child support (mandatory) and discretionary factors for spousal support.

## Part A: Child Support

### Child Support Guideline (Mandatory Formula)

Every state has a child support guideline—a formula that calculates support based on parents' incomes and timeshare (percentage of time with each parent). Courts must order guideline support unless specific statutory reasons justify deviation.

**Policy Behind Guidelines:**
- Children entitled to benefit from both parents' income
- Maintain children's standard of living post-divorce
- Consistency and predictability (same facts = same support)

**Basic Guideline Model (Most States Use One of Two):**

**Income Shares Model (Majority of States):**
- Premise: Child should receive same proportion of parental income as if parents were together
- Combines both parents' incomes
- Determines total child support obligation based on income + number of children (using state guideline table)
- Allocates obligation proportionately based on each parent's income share
- Example: Combined income $10,000/month, guideline table says $2,000 support for 2 kids. If Father earns 70% ($7,000), Mother 30% ($3,000), Father pays 70% of $2,000 = $1,400/month

**Percentage of Income Model (Fewer States, e.g., TX, WI):**
- Non-custodial parent pays percentage of their income (based on number of children)
- Example: Texas: 20% of net income for 1 child, 25% for 2 children, 30% for 3 children

**California Guideline Formula (Complex but Illustrative):**
California uses its own formula (most complex in the nation):

```
CS = K[HN – (H%)(TN)]

Where:
- CS = Child Support amount
- K = Amount of both parents' income to be allocated for child support (determined by formula based on income and timeshare)
- HN = High earner's net monthly disposable income
- H% = High earner's approximate percentage of time with children
- TN = Total net monthly disposable income of both parents
```

**Translation:** Higher-income parent's support obligation is based on their income, the other parent's income, and the percentage of time each parent has with children.

**Practical Point:** Do not calculate by hand. Use your state's official child support calculator (available online for most states or via attorney).

### Income Determination for Child Support

**Gross Income (Starting Point):**
Child support starts with each parent's "gross income" (before taxes). Gross income includes:
- Wages, salary, tips, bonuses, commissions, overtime
- Self-employment income (profit after legitimate business expenses, not after personal expenses disguised as business deductions)
- Rental income (net after expenses)
- Interest and dividend income
- Pension and annuity income
- Unemployment, workers' comp, disability benefits
- Social Security benefits
- Trust income
- Capital gains (if recurring)
- Spousal support received (counted as income in many states)
- Lottery winnings, gambling winnings (if regular)

**Excluded from Income:**
- Child support received
- Public assistance (TANF, SSI)
- Foster care subsidies
- Needs-based scholarships or grants

**Net Disposable Income (Some States, e.g., CA):**
California and some states use net disposable income (after taxes and mandatory deductions):
- Gross income
- Minus: Federal and state income tax (actual withholding or estimated if self-employed)
- Minus: Mandatory retirement contributions (not voluntary)
- Minus: Mandatory union dues
- Minus: Health insurance premiums (for self or children)
- Minus: Other mandatory deductions (garnishments, court-ordered support for other children)

= Net Disposable Income (used in CA guideline)

**Self-Employment Income (Commonly Disputed):**
- Start with gross receipts (business revenue)
- Minus: Legitimate ordinary and necessary business expenses (materials, supplies, business rent, employees, advertising)
- Do NOT deduct: Personal expenses (meals, vehicle for personal use, home office deduction if inflated, travel disguised as business)
- Court may add back personal expenses claimed as business deductions
- Depreciation: May be added back (non-cash expense; reduces taxable income but not actual cash flow available for support)

**Example:**
- Self-employed contractor's Schedule C shows:
  - Gross receipts: $150,000
  - Business expenses: $70,000 (includes $15,000 vehicle expenses for personal truck, $10,000 "meals and entertainment" that are personal)
  - Net income per tax return: $80,000
- Court disallows $25,000 personal expenses, adds back $10,000 depreciation
- Income for support: $80,000 + $25,000 + $10,000 = $115,000 (not $80,000)

**Imputed Income (When Parent Voluntarily Underemployed or Unemployed):**
If parent voluntarily quits job, reduces hours, or doesn't seek employment, court can "impute" income (attribute income they could be earning).

**When Imputed:**
- Parent quit job after divorce filed (without good reason)
- Parent with medical degree works part-time as barista (underemployed)
- Parent refuses to seek employment despite ability to work

**How Much Imputed:**
- Historical earnings (what parent earned before)
- Earning capacity based on education, skills, work history
- Minimum wage (if no job history and no reason for unemployment)

**Exceptions (No Imputation):**
- Caring for child under age 3 (custodial parent may stay home)
- Disability or medical condition prevents work
- Attending school/training that will increase future earnings
- Actively seeking employment (short-term unemployment due to layoff, not voluntary)

### Timeshare Adjustment (Parenting Time %)

Child support is reduced if non-custodial parent has children significant percentage of time (typically >20-30%).

**Why:**
- Parent with children more time incurs direct costs (food, utilities, gas)
- Guideline accounts for costs borne during parenting time
- Encourages shared parenting (more time = less support)

**Calculating Timeshare:**
```
Timeshare % = (Number of overnights with parent / 365 days) x 100
```

**Example:**
- Father has children every other weekend (Friday-Sunday, 2 overnights) + Wednesday overnight each week
- Per year: 52 weekends ÷ 2 = 26 weekends x 2 overnights = 52 overnights
- Wednesday overnights: 52 per year
- Total: 104 overnights / 365 = 28.5% timeshare

**Impact on Support:**
- 0-20% timeshare (every other weekend, no overnights during week): Full guideline support
- 20-40% timeshare: Reduced support (exact reduction varies by state; CA guideline formula automatically adjusts)
- 40-50% timeshare: Minimal support (may be zero or low amount if incomes similar)
- 50/50 timeshare: Support based solely on income disparity (higher earner pays lower earner to equalize; if incomes equal, no support)

### Add-Ons to Child Support (In Addition to Guideline)

**Mandatory Add-Ons (Paid Proportionately Based on Income):**
- **Childcare costs** (daycare, after-school care) necessary for parent to work or attend school
- **Uninsured medical expenses** (co-pays, prescriptions, dental, orthodontia, therapy, glasses)
- **Educational expenses** (private school tuition if both agree or children historically attended; tutoring if necessary)
- **Extracurricular activities** (sports, music lessons, camps—if reasonable and historically part of children's lives)

**How Add-Ons Work:**
- Parents share proportionately based on income percentage
- Example: Combined income $10,000/month; Father earns $7,000 (70%), Mother $3,000 (30%)
  - Daycare: $1,000/month → Father pays $700, Mother pays $300
  - Orthodontist: $5,000 total → Father pays $3,500, Mother pays $1,500

**Health Insurance:**
- Parent with access to health insurance through employer at reasonable cost must provide coverage
- Cost of children's premiums added to (or deducted from, depending on state) guideline support calculation
- If both parents have access, lower-cost option typically chosen

### Deviations from Guideline (Rare)

Courts presume guideline support is correct. To deviate (order higher or lower), party must prove:
1. Guideline amount would be unjust or inappropriate
2. Specific statutory reason for deviation applies
3. Deviation serves children's best interests

**Common Deviation Reasons:**

**Upward Deviations (Higher Than Guideline):**
- **Children have special needs** requiring extraordinary expenses (medical care, therapy, special education)
- **Extraordinarily high income** of parent (guideline maxes out; children entitled to benefit from parent's wealth)
- **Parent has assets producing passive income** not included in income calculation (children should benefit from investment income)

**Downward Deviations (Lower Than Guideline):**
- **Parent has other children to support** from different relationship (some states allow consideration; others prohibit)
- **Children spend significantly more time with paying parent** than reflected in formal custody order (actual timeshare differs from court order)
- **Paying parent has extraordinary expenses** (mandatory support for other children, catastrophic medical expenses)

**Cannot Deviate Based On:**
- Custodial parent's new partner's income (stepparent income not considered)
- Custodial parent "doesn't need the money" (support is children's right, not custodial parent's)
- Paying parent "can't afford it" (debt, lifestyle choices—court will impute income or require parent to adjust lifestyle)

### Duration of Child Support

**When Support Ends:**
- Child turns 18 AND graduates from high school (in most states)
- California, New York, some others: Age 18 or graduation, whichever is later (so child graduates at 19, support continues to 19)
- Some states: Support ends at 18 regardless of school
- Child emancipates early (marries, joins military, self-supporting)

**Continues Beyond 18 If:**
- Child has disability preventing self-support (support may continue indefinitely)
- Agreement or court order extends support (e.g., through college)
- State law mandates college support (New Jersey, Massachusetts—parents may be required to contribute to college)

**Post-Majority (College) Support:**
- Not required in most states unless agreed
- If agreed/ordered: Typically requires child to maintain full-time enrollment, minimum GPA, provide transcripts
- Amount: May be continuation of child support or different amount
- Duration: Through age 22-23 or bachelor's degree, whichever comes first

### Child Support Modifications

**When Can Support Be Modified?**
- Significant change in circumstances (income, timeshare, children's needs)
- Typically requires 10-20% change in income or significant custody change
- Time elapsed (some states allow review every 2-3 years)

**Common Modification Scenarios:**

**Income Change:**
- Paying parent loses job or income drops significantly (can request reduction)
- Receiving parent's income increases (payor may request reduction)
- Paying parent's income increases (recipient may request increase)

**Custody/Timeshare Change:**
- Custody switches (children now live primarily with paying parent → child support should switch direction)
- Timeshare changes significantly (paying parent now has 40% time instead of 20% → support reduced)

**Children's Needs Change:**
- Child develops medical condition requiring expensive treatment (increase)
- Child ages out of daycare (decrease if daycare was add-on)

**Process:**
1. File motion to modify child support (with income and expense declaration)
2. Serve other parent
3. Court hearing or stipulation
4. New support order entered

**Effective Date:**
- Modification effective from date of filing motion (not retroactive to when circumstances changed)
- If you lose job in January, file modification in June, new support starts in June (you still owe January-May at old rate)

**Lesson:** File modification immediately when circumstances change; do not wait.

### Child Support Enforcement

**If Paying Parent Doesn't Pay:**

**Wage Assignment (Automatic):**
- Child support orders include mandatory wage assignment (support withheld from payor's paycheck and sent directly to recipient)
- Employer required to comply
- If payor quits or is self-employed, wage assignment doesn't help (need other enforcement)

**Enforcement Mechanisms:**

**1. Contempt of Court:**
- File motion for contempt (payor violated court order)
- If found in contempt: Jail time (up to 5 days per $1,000 owed), fines, attorney fees
- Payor must "purge" contempt by paying owed support

**2. Suspended License:**
- Department of Motor Vehicles or professional licensing board suspends driver's license, professional license (doctor, lawyer, contractor) if support arrears exceed certain amount
- Reinstated upon payment or payment plan

**3. Tax Refund Intercept:**
- State child support agency intercepts federal and state tax refunds and applies to arrears

**4. Credit Reporting:**
- Child support arrears reported to credit bureaus (damages credit score)

**5. Liens:**
- Court places lien on payor's property (house, car, business) securing debt
- If property sold, arrears paid from proceeds

**6. Passport Denial:**
- Federal law: If arrears exceed $2,500, passport can be denied or revoked

**Collecting Arrears:**
- Arrears (past-due support) do not go away—owed until paid, even after children turn 18
- Interest accrues on arrears (10% per year in CA)
- Cannot be discharged in bankruptcy

## Part B: Spousal Support (Alimony)

### Types of Spousal Support

**1. Temporary Spousal Support (Pendente Lite):**
- Paid during divorce proceedings (from filing to judgment)
- Purpose: Maintain status quo; allow lower-earning spouse to afford living expenses and attorney fees during case
- Calculation: Often uses formula (e.g., CA: 40% of high earner's net income minus 50% of low earner's net income, minus any child support)
- Duration: Until permanent support order or judgment
- Less discretion; courts usually follow formula

**2. Rehabilitative (Transitional) Spousal Support:**
- Short-to-medium term (1-5 years typically)
- Purpose: Allow lower-earning spouse time to become self-supporting (complete education, reenter workforce, gain skills)
- Common in: Marriages of 5-10 years; recipient has earning capacity but needs time
- Terminates: When recipient becomes self-supporting or at predetermined date

**3. Permanent (Long-Term) Spousal Support:**
- Payable until death of either party, remarriage of recipient, or court order modifying/terminating
- Purpose: Long-term economic balancing when recipient cannot become fully self-supporting (age, health, long marriage, sacrificed career for family)
- Common in: Long marriages (15+ years); recipient is older and/or has limited earning capacity
- "Permanent" is misnomer: Still modifiable and terminates on remarriage or death (but called "permanent" to distinguish from rehabilitative)

**4. Reimbursement Alimony (Rare):**
- Compensates spouse who supported other through education/training (put partner through medical school, then partner divorces)
- Purpose: Reimburse investment in partner's earning capacity
- Not common; most states fold this into general spousal support analysis

### Factors Courts Consider for Spousal Support

No formula for permanent spousal support (unlike child support). Court considers statutory factors, including:

**California Family Code § 4320 (Typical Factors in Most States):**

1. **Marital Standard of Living:**
   - How did couple live during marriage? (Housing, vacations, dining, activities)
   - Goal: Maintain reasonable standard consistent with marital lifestyle (both parties may step down)

2. **Marketable Skills and Job Market:**
   - What education, training, skills does recipient have?
   - Can recipient obtain employment? At what income level?
   - Does recipient need retraining or education?

3. **Extent to Which Earning Capacity Is Impaired by Unemployment to Care for Children:**
   - Did recipient stay home with children? (Sacrifice career advancement)
   - Will recipient continue to be primary caregiver post-divorce?

4. **Contribution to Education, Training, Career of Other Spouse:**
   - Did recipient support payor through school? (Work while payor got MBA, medical degree)
   - Sacrifice own career to support other's advancement?

5. **Ability of Supporting Spouse to Pay:**
   - Payor's income, assets, expenses
   - Can payor maintain reasonable standard while paying support?

6. **Needs of Each Party:**
   - Recipient's reasonable expenses
   - Payor's obligations (child support, other dependents)

7. **Assets and Debts:**
   - Property division provides assets to recipient? (May reduce support if recipient has income-producing assets)

8. **Duration of Marriage:**
   - Short marriage (<5 years): Little or no support, short duration
   - Medium marriage (5-15 years): Rehabilitative support, 1/3 to 1/2 length of marriage
   - Long marriage (15+ years, CA; 20+ years many states): Permanent support until retirement age or remarriage

9. **Age and Health:**
   - Older recipient with health issues: Less likely to become self-supporting, more likely to receive long-term support
   - Young, healthy recipient: Expected to become self-supporting

10. **History of Domestic Violence:**
    - If payor abused recipient: May increase support amount or duration (compensation for abuse, especially if abuse impacted earning capacity)
    - California: Rebuttable presumption against support for abuser (if recipient abused payor, recipient may receive no support)

11. **Tax Consequences (Pre-2019 Divorces):**
    - Old law: Payor deducted alimony; recipient included as income → Tax benefit influenced amount
    - New law (post-2018): No deduction, no inclusion → Tax neutral; payor may argue for lower amount

12. **Criminal Conviction of Abusive Spouse:**
    - California: Conviction for domestic violence against spouse reduces or eliminates support to abuser

13. **Balance of Hardships:**
    - Which party will suffer more without support?

**Weight of Factors:**
- No single factor is determinative
- Longer marriage + greater income disparity + recipient's limited earning capacity = higher and longer support
- Shorter marriage + recipient's strong earning capacity + similar incomes = little or no support

### Calculating Spousal Support Amount (No Fixed Formula)

**Temporary Support:** Many states use formula:
- California: 40% of payor's net income minus 50% of recipient's net income (minus child support payor already pays)
- Example: Husband earns $10,000/month net; Wife earns $3,000/month net; no children
  - Temporary support = (0.40 x $10,000) - (0.50 x $3,000) = $4,000 - $1,500 = $2,500/month

**Permanent Support:** No formula. Court considers factors above and determines reasonable amount.

**Common Approaches:**

**1. Needs-Based:**
- Calculate recipient's reasonable monthly expenses (housing, food, transportation, insurance, etc.)
- Subtract recipient's income
- Gap = support amount (if payor can afford)
- Example: Wife needs $5,000/month, earns $2,000 → Support = $3,000/month

**2. Income Percentage:**
- Award percentage of payor's income
- Example: Wife receives 20-30% of Husband's gross income
- Used when payor has high income (needs-based approach would result in very high support)

**3. Marital Standard of Living:**
- Determine couple's monthly expenses during marriage
- Allocate proportionately based on earning capacity
- Each party maintains similar (but likely reduced) standard

**4. Paverage (Practice Varies by County/Judge):**
- Some counties/judges use computerized programs (DissoMaster in CA) that calculate both temporary and permanent support
- Others rely purely on statutory factors

**Income Disparity:**
- Greater disparity = higher support
- Example: Husband earns $20,000/month, Wife earns $2,000 → Significant support likely
- Example: Husband earns $8,000/month, Wife earns $6,000 → Minimal or no support

### Duration of Spousal Support

**General Rules (Vary by State):**

**Short-Term Marriage (<5 years in CA, <10 years many states):**
- Support duration: 0 to 1/2 length of marriage
- Example: 4-year marriage → 0-2 years support
- Purpose: Brief support to transition; expectation of self-sufficiency

**Medium-Term Marriage (5-15 years CA, 10-20 years many states):**
- Support duration: 1/3 to 1/2 length of marriage (rule of thumb, not binding)
- Example: 10-year marriage → 3-5 years support
- Purpose: Rehabilitative; time to retrain and become self-supporting

**Long-Term Marriage (15+ years CA, 20+ years many states):**
- Court retains jurisdiction indefinitely (no set end date)
- Support continues until: Remarriage of recipient, death of either party, court order terminating (if recipient becomes self-supporting), payor's retirement (may reduce or terminate)
- Not truly "permanent"—but no presumed end date

**California "Rule of Thumb" (Not Mandatory):**
- Duration = 1/2 length of marriage for marriages under 10 years
- Example: 8-year marriage → 4 years support
- 10+ year marriage = "long-term" → Court retains jurisdiction indefinitely

**Modifiability:**
- Most spousal support is modifiable (can be increased, decreased, or terminated based on change in circumstances)
- Exception: If parties agree to "non-modifiable" support (contractual alimony), court cannot change amount (but may still terminate early in some circumstances)

### Automatic Termination of Spousal Support

**Remarriage of Recipient:**
- Support terminates automatically
- Payor need not file motion
- If recipient hiding remarriage and continuing to collect support: Contempt, must repay

**Death of Either Party:**
- Support terminates (unless parties agreed to continue post-death and secured with life insurance or estate provision)

**Cohabitation:**
- Many states: Support reduced or terminated if recipient cohabitates with new partner in marriage-like relationship
- Burden on payor to prove: Cohabitation, financial interdependence, holding out as couple
- Not automatic—requires motion and hearing

**Recipient Becomes Self-Supporting:**
- Payor can file motion to terminate if recipient's earning capacity has increased such that support no longer needed
- Burden on payor to prove change in circumstances

### Spousal Support Modification

**When Modifiable:**
- Significant change in circumstances (income, needs, cohabitation, health, retirement)
- Either party can request increase, decrease, or termination

**Common Modification Scenarios:**

**Payor's Income Decreases:**
- Layoff, reduction in salary, retirement, disability
- Can request reduction or termination
- Must be involuntary or reasonable (voluntary job change without good reason won't justify reduction)

**Recipient's Income Increases:**
- Obtains job, gets promotion, remarries (automatic termination)
- Payor can request reduction or termination

**Recipient Cohabitates:**
- Living with new partner in marriage-like relationship
- Payor requests reduction or termination (shows recipient has reduced need)

**Payor Retires:**
- Retirement at normal retirement age (65-67) usually justifies reduction or termination
- Early retirement may not (if done to avoid support)
- Court considers: Payor's age, health, retirement income, length of retirement planning

**Change in Needs:**
- Recipient develops health condition requiring expensive treatment (increase)
- Children no longer dependents, reducing recipient's expenses (decrease)

**Non-Modifiable Support:**
- If parties agreed in writing to "non-modifiable" support, court cannot change amount
- Still terminates on remarriage or death
- Used when: Payor wants certainty (won't be asked for more); Recipient wants security (won't be reduced)

### Cohabitation and Support

**Impact of Recipient's Cohabitation with New Partner:**
Many states allow reduction or termination of support if recipient cohabitates in marriage-like relationship.

**Burden of Proof (On Payor):**
1. **Cohabitation:** Living together, not just dating
2. **Marriage-Like Relationship:**
   - Shared residence
   - Shared expenses (rent, utilities, groceries)
   - Financial interdependence (joint accounts, shared bills)
   - Holding out as couple (introduce as partner, attend events together)
   - Sexual relationship
   - Duration (not one-night stays; sustained cohabitation)

**Evidence:**
- Lease or mortgage showing both names
- Utility bills showing both names
- Photos from social media (vacations together, references to "my partner")
- Testimony from neighbors, friends (how couple presents themselves)
- Financial records (transfers between accounts, shared expenses)

**Defenses:**
- "We're roommates, not romantic partners"
- "I pay rent to him" (show rental agreement, canceled checks)
- "We don't share finances" (separate accounts, no commingling)

**Result if Cohabitation Proven:**
- Reduction in support (recipient's need reduced by partner's contribution)
- Termination (if partner fully supporting recipient)

**Timing:**
- Effective from date of filing motion (not retroactive)
- If payor delays filing (cohabitation started years ago, just now filing), court may question why delay

### Securing Spousal Support with Life Insurance

**Problem:**
If payor dies before support obligation ends, recipient loses income.

**Solution:**
Require payor to maintain life insurance with recipient as beneficiary.

**Typical Provision:**
```
Life Insurance to Secure Support:
- Payor shall maintain life insurance policy with death benefit of at least $[amount] with Recipient as sole irrevocable beneficiary.
- Amount calculated as: Remaining support obligation (monthly support x months remaining).
- Policy shall remain in effect until: Support obligation terminates (recipient remarries, recipient's death, or court-ordered termination).
- Payor shall provide Recipient with proof of policy and premium payments annually.
- If Payor fails to maintain insurance, Payor's estate shall be liable for remaining support obligation.
```

**Calculating Amount:**
Example: Payor owes $3,000/month for 10 years (120 months) = $360,000 total remaining obligation. Life insurance policy: $360,000 death benefit.

**Reducing Benefit Over Time:**
As support obligation decreases (years pass), required insurance amount decreases. Payor can reduce coverage to match remaining obligation.

## Part C: Tax Consequences of Support

### Tax Treatment of Spousal Support (Critical Post-2018 Change)

**Old Law (Divorces Finalized Before Jan 1, 2019):**
- Payor deducted alimony from income (reduced payor's taxes)
- Recipient included alimony as income (increased recipient's taxes)
- Tax benefit to payor (often in higher tax bracket) meant payor could afford to pay more

**New Law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—Divorces Finalized After Dec 31, 2018):**
- **Payor CANNOT deduct alimony** (no tax benefit)
- **Recipient does NOT include alimony as income** (no tax owed)
- Tax-neutral

**Impact on Negotiations:**
- **Post-2018 Divorces:** Payor may negotiate for lower alimony amount (no tax benefit, so less willing to pay high amount)
- **Pre-2019 Divorces Modified:** Modification does NOT change tax treatment (still deductible/includible unless parties affirmatively opt in to new law)

**Important:** This distinction applies based on date of divorce finalization, not separation or filing.

### Tax Treatment of Child Support

- **Never deductible** by payor
- **Never taxable** to recipient
- Tax-neutral (always has been, even before 2018 tax reform)

### Dependency Exemption and Child Tax Credit

**Dependency Exemption (Suspended 2018-2025 Under TCJA):**
- Pre-2018 and Post-2025: Parent claiming child as dependent received exemption (reduced taxable income by $4,000+ per child)
- 2018-2025: Exemption suspended (worth $0) but still matters for other benefits

**Child Tax Credit (Valuable):**
- $2,000 per child under 17 (as of 2024)
- Reduces tax owed dollar-for-dollar (worth $2,000 per child to parent in any tax bracket)

**Default Rule:**
- Custodial parent (parent with whom child spends majority of overnights) claims dependency exemption and child tax credit

**Divorce Decree Can Allocate Differently:**
- Award to non-custodial parent (if payor has higher income, gets more tax benefit)
- Alternate years (even years Mother claims, odd years Father claims)
- Split if multiple children (Mother claims one child, Father claims other)

**Form 8332 Required:**
- For non-custodial parent to claim child, custodial parent must sign IRS Form 8332 (Release of Claim to Exemption)
- Provided to non-custodial parent annually (or for multiple years)
- Non-custodial parent attaches to tax return

**Typical Provision:**
```
Tax Dependency Exemption and Credits:
- Mother shall claim [Child A] as dependent; Father shall claim [Child B] as dependent.
- Mother shall execute IRS Form 8332 releasing her claim to [Child B]'s exemption to Father annually by February 1.
- Father shall execute IRS Form 8332 releasing his claim to [Child A]'s exemption to Mother annually by February 1.
- If either party fails to timely execute Form 8332, breaching party shall pay other party $[2,000] (value of lost tax credit).
```

**Head of Household Filing Status:**
- More favorable than "Single" (higher standard deduction, lower tax rates)
- Requires: Unmarried, paid more than half cost of maintaining home, qualifying child lived with taxpayer more than half the year
- Custodial parent typically qualifies
- If 50/50 custody: Parent with higher income usually files Head of Household (gets more tax benefit); other files Single
- Divorce decree should specify who claims Head of Household

**Negotiation Strategy:**
- Parent with higher income gets more tax benefit from dependency exemption/child tax credit
- May trade: Higher earner pays slightly more support in exchange for claiming child
- Or alternate years to share benefit

### Other Tax Considerations

**Filing Status During Divorce:**
- Until divorce final, can file Married Filing Jointly (MFJ) or Married Filing Separately (MFS)
- MFJ: Lower taxes (combine incomes, use married rates, higher standard deduction)
- MFS: Higher taxes but protects from other spouse's tax issues (if spouse underreports income, has tax debt)
- Divorce final by Dec 31: Must file Single or Head of Household for that year

**Filing MFJ During Divorce:**
- Requires cooperation (both must sign)
- Split refund per agreement or court order
- Both liable for any tax owed (if audit reveals underpayment, both responsible)
- If cooperation: File MFJ, split refund 50/50 or per negotiation
- If non-cooperation: File MFS and incur higher taxes

**Legal Fees:**
- Attorney fees for divorce are NOT tax-deductible (personal expense)
- Exception: Fees allocable to tax advice or alimony (can deduct portion related to tax planning)

**Property Transfers:**
- Transfers between spouses (or ex-spouses within 1 year of divorce, or pursuant to divorce decree) are NOT taxable
- Recipient takes donor's tax basis (cost basis)

**Retirement Account Division:**
- QDRO transfers not taxable at time of transfer
- Taxes paid when recipient withdraws funds in retirement

## Part D: Strategic Considerations

### Negotiating Support vs. Litigating

**Settlement Advantages:**
- Control: You decide amount and duration (not judge's discretion)
- Flexibility: Structure creative solutions (lump sum, non-modifiable, offset against property)
- Tax planning: Structure to minimize taxes (especially pre-2019 divorces)
- Speed: Resolve in weeks/months vs. trial in 1-2 years
- Cost: Avoid expert fees (vocational evaluators, forensic accountants testifying about income)

**Settlement Strategies:**

**Lump-Sum Alimony:**
- One-time payment instead of monthly support
- Advantages (Payor): Clean break, no ongoing obligation, no modification risk
- Advantages (Recipient): Certainty, can invest lump sum, no collection risk
- Tax treatment: If structured as property division (not alimony), tax-free to recipient
- Discount for present value (paying now vs. over years)

**Non-Modifiable Support:**
- Agreement that support amount cannot be changed (but terminates on remarriage/death)
- Advantages (Payor): Certainty (if income increases, won't be asked for more)
- Advantages (Recipient): Security (if payor's income drops, support doesn't decrease)

**Step-Down Support:**
- Support reduces over time on predetermined schedule
- Example: $5,000/month for 3 years, $3,000/month for 2 years, $1,500/month for 2 years, then terminates
- Reflects recipient's increasing earning capacity over time

**Offset Against Property Division:**
- Reduce or waive support in exchange for larger share of property
- Example: Husband waives alimony claim in exchange for keeping 60% of community assets (instead of 50%)

**Hybrid: Rehabilitative + Small Permanent:**
- Higher support for 3-5 years (rehabilitative while recipient retrains), then reduces to small permanent amount

### Income Disparity and Support Negotiations

**High Earner Strategies (Paying Support):**
- Argue for shorter duration (recipient has earning capacity, will become self-supporting)
- Front-load property division (give recipient more property now, reduce monthly support)
- Offer lump sum (one-time payment to avoid monthly obligation)
- Emphasize recipient's education and work history (capable of earning good income)
- Request vocational evaluation (expert assesses recipient's earning capacity)

**Lower Earner Strategies (Receiving Support):**
- Emphasize marital standard of living (lived comfortably, should continue)
- Show earning capacity impaired by career sacrifices for family (stayed home with children, supported spouse's career, moved for spouse's job)
- Demonstrate limited job market (age, outdated skills, health issues, competitive market)
- Request long-term support if long marriage (court retains jurisdiction indefinitely)
- Secure with life insurance (protect against payor's death)

### Imputing Income to Recipient

If recipient voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, payor may argue for income imputation (attribute higher income to recipient, reducing support).

**Grounds for Imputation:**
- Recipient quit job after separation (without good reason)
- Recipient capable of earning more based on education, skills, experience
- Recipient working part-time when could work full-time

**Vocational Evaluation:**
- Payor may hire vocational evaluator (expert assesses recipient's earning capacity)
- Evaluator reviews: Recipient's education, work history, job market, transferrable skills, physical limitations
- Produces report: "Recipient capable of earning $X per year in [field]"
- Cost: $3,000-8,000
- Court may adopt evaluator's opinion and impute that income

**Defenses:**
- Caring for young children (staying home with child under 3-5)
- Health or disability prevents work
- Actively seeking employment (unemployed due to layoff, not choice)
- Attending school/retraining (will increase earning capacity)

### Retirement and Support

**Payor Retires:**
- Retirement at normal age (65-67) usually justifies reduction or termination of support
- Court considers: Payor's retirement income (Social Security, pension, retirement accounts), ability to maintain payments, whether retirement was planned or sudden

**Early Retirement:**
- Retiring early (before 62) to avoid support: Court may deny modification (voluntary reduction in income)
- Retiring early for valid reason (health, mandatory retirement age for profession): Court more likely to grant modification

**Calculating Post-Retirement Support:**
- Apply same factors: Payor's income (now retirement income), recipient's income, needs
- Often results in reduced support (payor's income lower) or termination (if both parties now living on retirement income)

**Planning:**
- Judgment should address retirement: "Support modifiable upon payor's retirement at normal retirement age" OR "Support non-modifiable; continues through payor's retirement"

## Part E: Common Mistakes

### Support Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Not Running Guideline Calculation Before Negotiating Child Support**
- **Mistake:** Agreeing to child support amount without knowing guideline figure (may agree to pay too much or accept too little)
- **Fix:** Use state's official calculator; know guideline amount before negotiating

**2. Failing to Update Income Information**
- **Mistake:** Using outdated income figures (last year's tax return when income has increased 30%)
- **Fix:** Use current pay stubs, YTD earnings statements; project current year income

**3. Agreeing to Non-Guideline Child Support Without Understanding Consequences**
- **Mistake:** Agreeing to $500/month when guideline is $2,000 (violates children's rights; court may not approve)
- **Fix:** Child support must be guideline unless valid statutory reason for deviation and court approves

**4. Not Addressing Add-Ons (Childcare, Medical, Extracurriculars)**
- **Mistake:** Agreeing to guideline support but not specifying how childcare, medical expenses, extracurriculars are paid (leads to conflict)
- **Fix:** Explicitly state how add-ons are shared (proportional to income) and process for approval/reimbursement

**5. Imputing Bonus Income That Isn't Guaranteed**
- **Mistake:** Calculating support based on $200K salary + $50K annual bonus, but bonus is discretionary (may not be paid)
- **Fix:** If bonus is discretionary, use base salary for guideline; address bonuses separately ("Payor pays 20% of any bonus received as additional child support within 30 days of receipt")

**6. Accepting Spousal Support Without Life Insurance**
- **Mistake:** Agreeing to $4,000/month support for 10 years but no life insurance; payor dies year 2, recipient loses 8 years of support
- **Fix:** Require life insurance equal to remaining support obligation

**7. Not Considering Tax Implications (Post-2018 Divorces)**
- **Mistake:** Payor agreeing to $5,000/month alimony thinking they'll get tax deduction (no deduction post-2018)
- **Fix:** Understand alimony is not deductible; negotiate accordingly (may offer lower amount since no tax benefit)

**8. Failing to Specify Cohabitation Termination Clause**
- **Mistake:** Support order silent on cohabitation; recipient cohabitates with new partner, payor must file motion and prove cohabitation to terminate
- **Fix:** Include provision: "Support terminates if recipient cohabitates with unrelated adult in marriage-like relationship for 60+ consecutive days"

**9. Agreeing to Modifiable Support When Should Be Non-Modifiable (or Vice Versa)**
- **Mistake:** High earner agrees to modifiable support; income doubles, ex-spouse requests increase
- **Fix:** If high earner with fluctuating income, negotiate non-modifiable support (certainty) OR lower base amount with bonus tied to income

**10. Not Filing Modification When Circumstances Change**
- **Mistake:** Losing job in January, not filing modification until September (still owe January-August at old amount)
- **Fix:** File modification immediately when income drops, custody changes, or other material change occurs

## Summary: Key Takeaways

1. **Child support follows mandatory guideline formulas.** Calculate using state's official calculator. Deviations require statutory grounds and court approval. Child support includes base amount + add-ons (childcare, uninsured medical, extracurriculars).

2. **Income determination is critical for both child and spousal support.** Include all sources of income. Self-employed income requires scrutiny (disallow personal expenses claimed as business deductions). Courts can impute income if voluntarily underemployed.

3. **Timeshare affects child support.** More time with non-custodial parent = reduced support (guideline adjusts for costs borne during parenting time).

4. **Spousal support has no formula (except temporary support).** Court considers statutory factors: Length of marriage, earning capacity, marital standard of living, contributions, age/health. Longer marriage + greater income disparity = higher and longer support.

5. **Duration rules vary by state.** Short marriage = short support; long marriage = indefinite (court retains jurisdiction). "Permanent" support still terminates on remarriage, death, or if recipient becomes self-supporting.

6. **Tax treatment of alimony changed in 2019 (TCJA).** Post-2018 divorces: Alimony NOT deductible by payor, NOT taxable to recipient. Pre-2019 divorces: Still deductible/includible unless modified and opt into new law. This affects negotiation leverage.

7. **Child support is never deductible, never taxable.** Tax-neutral for both parties.

8. **Secure spousal support with life insurance.** Require payor maintain policy with recipient as beneficiary (amount = remaining support obligation). Protects recipient if payor dies before support ends.

9. **Support is modifiable based on material change in circumstances** (income, timeshare, needs). File modification immediately when change occurs (effective from filing date, not retroactive). Arrears never go away—owed until paid, with interest.

10. **Settlement gives control and flexibility.** Negotiate creative structures: Lump sum alimony, non-modifiable support, step-down schedules, offsets against property division. Avoids uncertainty of trial and reduces legal fees.
