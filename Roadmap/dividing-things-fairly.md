# Dividing Things Fairly: Property Division Reference

**Written by:** financial-forensics agent

This is your comprehensive reference for property division. For detailed guidance, see [Stage 8: Property Division](08-property-division.md). This guide consolidates key principles and quick-reference tables.

## Core Principles

**Community Property States (9 states: AZ, CA, ID, LA, NV, NM, TX, WA, WI):**
- Presumption: 50/50 division of community property
- Community property = acquired during marriage (date of marriage to separation)
- Separate property = owned before marriage, after separation, or received by gift/inheritance during marriage

**Equitable Distribution States (41 states + DC):**
- "Fair" division, not necessarily 50/50
- Courts consider factors: Length of marriage, income disparity, contributions, age/health, fault (some states)
- Typical range: 40/60 to 60/40 in moderate cases

## Asset Characterization Quick Reference

| Asset Type | Community/Marital | Separate | Mixed |
|------------|-------------------|----------|-------|
| **Wages/Salary** | Earned during marriage | Earned before marriage or after separation | N/A |
| **House** | Purchased during marriage with community funds | Owned before marriage; or purchased with separate funds (inheritance); or purchased after separation | Bought before marriage, mortgage paid with community funds (reimbursement claim) |
| **401k/IRA** | Portion earned during marriage | Portion earned before marriage or after separation | Time-rule formula (see below) |
| **Pension** | Portion earned during marriage | Portion earned before marriage or after separation | Coverture fraction |
| **Business** | Started during marriage; or increased in value due to community labor | Owned before marriage, passive growth | Owned before marriage, active growth during marriage |
| **Vehicle** | Purchased during marriage | Purchased before marriage or after separation with separate funds | N/A (usually all community or all separate) |
| **Inheritance** | NEVER (unless commingled) | Always separate to recipient | If deposited in joint account and spent, may lose separate character |
| **Gift to One Spouse** | Never | Always separate | If commingled, may lose separate character |

**Burden of Proof:** Party claiming separate property must prove it (with tracing, documentation).

## Valuation Reference

| Asset | Valuation Method | Who Values | Typical Cost |
|-------|------------------|------------|--------------|
| **Real Property (Home)** | Recent sale price; or Comparative Market Analysis (CMA); or Professional appraisal | Realtor (CMA: free); or Licensed appraiser ($400-$600) | $400-$600 |
| **Vehicles** | Kelley Blue Book (KBB), NADA, Edmunds (private party value) | Online tools (free) | Free |
| **Business** | Income approach (capitalized earnings); Market approach (comparable sales); Asset approach | Certified business appraiser (CVA, ASA, CPA) | $5,000-$30,000+ |
| **Retirement (401k, IRA)** | Account balance on valuation date | Account statement | Free (just request statement) |
| **Pension** | Present value (actuarial); or If-as-when | Actuary (for present value) | $2,000-$5,000 for actuarial |
| **Stock Options** | Black-Scholes or similar model; or Current spread (FMV - strike price) | Financial advisor or company | Varies |
| **Personal Property** | Fair market value (resale value, not replacement) | Online comps (eBay, Craigslist); or Appraiser for high-value items | Free to $500+ |

**Valuation Date:** Typically separation date (community property states) or trial date (equitable distribution states). Check your jurisdiction.

## Retirement Division: Time Rule Formula

**For 401k, IRA, 403b, 457:**

```
Community % = (Months employed during marriage) / (Total months employed at valuation date)

Example:
- Employed 2010-2024 (168 months)
- Married 2015-2023 (96 months)
- Community % = 96 / 168 = 57%

If 401k balance = $300,000:
- Community portion: $300,000 x 57% = $171,000
- Separate portion: $129,000
- Each spouse: $85,500 (half of $171,000)
```

**For Pensions (Coverture Fraction):**

```
Community % = (Months employed during marriage) / (Months employed at retirement)

Example:
- Employed 2005-2035 (30 years = 360 months)
- Married 2010-2023 (13 years = 156 months)
- Coverture fraction = 156 / 360 = 43%

If pension pays $4,000/month at retirement:
- Community portion: $4,000 x 43% = $1,720/month
- Each spouse receives: $860/month (half of $1,720)
```

## QDRO Requirements

**Accounts REQUIRING QDRO:**
- 401(k), 403(b), 457 plans
- Pensions (defined benefit plans)
- Thrift Savings Plan (TSP for federal employees)

**Accounts NOT Requiring QDRO:**
- IRAs (use direct trustee-to-trustee transfer)
- Non-qualified deferred compensation (follow plan rules)

**QDRO Process:**
1. Hire QDRO specialist attorney ($500-$2,000)
2. Draft QDRO
3. Submit to plan for pre-approval
4. File with court for judge's signature
5. Serve on plan administrator
6. Plan executes division (30-90 days)

**Timeline:** Should be completed within 60-90 days of judgment. DO NOT DELAY.

---

## Debt Allocation Principles

**Community/Marital Debt:**
- Incurred during marriage for community benefit (mortgage, car loan, credit cards for household expenses)
- Divided 50/50 (community property) or equitably (equitable distribution)

**Separate Debt:**
- Incurred before marriage
- Incurred after separation
- Incurred during marriage for one spouse's sole benefit (student loans from before marriage in some states)

**Assigning Debt:**
- Judgment assigns who pays which debt
- BUT creditors not bound by judgment (if joint debt, both liable until refinanced/paid)

**Protection:**
- Refinance joint debts in one spouse's name alone (removes other from liability)
- Close joint credit cards
- Indemnification clause ("If assigned spouse doesn't pay, must reimburse other")

## Tax Implications Quick Reference

| Transaction | Taxable? | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Property transfer (incident to divorce)** | No | Transfers between spouses (or ex-spouses within 1 year or per decree) not taxable |
| **Retirement account division (via QDRO)** | No (at time of transfer) | Recipient pays tax when withdraws in retirement |
| **IRA division** | No (if direct transfer) | Must be trustee-to-trustee transfer |
| **Home sale** | Potentially | $250K capital gains exclusion per person if primary residence 2 of past 5 years |
| **Investment account transfer** | No (at time of transfer) | Taxes owed when recipient sells (capital gains) |
| **Alimony (post-2018 divorces)** | No | Not deductible by payor, not taxable to recipient |
| **Alimony (pre-2019 divorces)** | Yes | Deductible by payor, taxable income to recipient |
| **Child support** | No | Never deductible, never taxable |

**After-Tax Value Matters:**
- Retirement accounts: Taxes owed upon withdrawal (worth ~70-75% of face value after taxes)
- Investment accounts with gains: Capital gains tax owed when sold (worth less than balance)
- Cash: Worth full value (already taxed)

**Example:**
- $100K in 401k ≠ $100K cash
- $100K in 401k → ~$75K after taxes (assuming 25% tax rate)
- Fair division: $100K 401k to Spouse A, $75K cash to Spouse B (equal after-tax value)

---

## Division Structures

**Option 1: In-Kind Division**
- Each spouse keeps certain assets
- Equalization payment if values unequal

Example:
- Wife keeps house ($300K equity), Husband keeps 401k ($300K)
- Equal division, no payment needed

**Option 2: Offset Agreement**
- Trade assets of equivalent value

Example:
- Husband keeps house ($400K equity) + owes Wife $200K equalization payment
- Wife keeps full 401k ($400K), no payment from Husband
- Offset: $200K payment from Husband = Wife's share of house

**Option 3: Sell and Divide**
- Sell major assets (house, business)
- Split proceeds

Example:
- Sell house for $600K (net $550K after costs)
- Each receives $275K cash
- Divide retirement accounts 50/50 via QDRO

**Option 4: Deferred Sale**
- Delay sale until future event (child graduates high school)
- One spouse lives in home, both remain on title/mortgage
- Sell later, split proceeds

Pros: Children's stability
Cons: Both tied to mortgage; risk if home value drops

---

## Common Reimbursement Claims

**Epstein Credits (Community Paid Separate Debt):**
- If community funds paid separate property debt (mortgage on pre-marital house, student loan from before marriage), community gets credit

Example:
- Husband's premarital house: $50K mortgage paydown during marriage using community income
- Community entitled to $50K reimbursement
- Each spouse receives $25K from Husband's house proceeds

**Watts Charges (Separate Spouse Used Community Property):**
- If one spouse had exclusive use of community property home post-separation, may owe "rent"

Example:
- Wife lived in community home 2 years post-separation
- Fair rent: $2,500/month
- Watts charges: $2,500 x 24 = $60,000
- Husband's share: $30,000 (half of Watts charges)

**Moore-Marsden (Community Contributions to Separate Property Appreciation):**
- If community funds improved separate property (paid down mortgage, renovations), community entitled to share of appreciation

Formula:
```
Community % of appreciation = (Community contributions / Total contributions) x Appreciation

Example:
- Husband's premarital house: Purchased $300K (down $100K separate)
- Mortgage paydown during marriage: $100K (community)
- Value at separation: $600K
- Appreciation: $300K
- Total contributions: $200K ($100K separate + $100K community)
- Community % of appreciation: ($100K / $200K) x $300K = $150K
- Wife's share: $75K
```

## Negotiation Strategies

**Know Your BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement):**
- What's likely division at trial?
- Community property: ~50/50
- Equitable distribution: Research typical outcomes in your jurisdiction

**Package Proposals:**
- Don't negotiate asset-by-asset
- Create complete package: "I keep house, you keep 401k, we split investments"

**Use Objective Anchors:**
- Appraisals (house value)
- Account statements (retirement balance)
- Guidelines (if applicable)

**Identify Trades:**
- "If you agree to me keeping house (your priority: family home), I'll accept lower spousal support (my priority: monthly income)"

**Tax Efficiency:**
- Structure division to minimize taxes for both (benefits both parties)
- Example: Divide retirement accounts (tax-free transfer) rather than cashing out (taxable event)

## Red Flags: Unfair Proposals

| Red Flag | Fair Response |
|----------|---------------|
| "I keep 401k ($300K), you keep house ($200K equity)"—unequal values | "Values aren't equal. Either equalize ($50K payment to me) or sell house and divide all assets 50/50." |
| "My premarital business increased $500K during marriage, but that's my separate property" | "Business growth during marriage due to your labor is community property. We need valuation." |
| "I'm keeping my retirement ($400K), you keep yours ($150K)" | "That's not equal division. Community property is divided 50/50: We each get $275K total retirement." |
| "You can have the house but you pay me for my share ($150K) within 30 days" | "I can't get $150K in 30 days. Either extend to 90 days, allow installment payments, or I'll refinance." |
| "I'll pay off the credit card debt ($30K), you handle the mortgage arrears ($40K)" | "That's not equal debt allocation. We should split total debt ($70K) = $35K each." |

**If Proposal Seems Unfair:**
- Calculate total value to each party (property + support PV + debt)
- Compare to 50/50 (or equitable range for your state)
- Counter with objective justification

- [ ] Characterize each asset (community/marital vs. separate)
- [ ] Value each asset (appraisals, statements, online tools)
- [ ] Identify all debts (mortgage, vehicles, credit cards, loans, other)
- [ ] Characterize debts (community vs. separate)
- [ ] Calculate total community/marital estate (assets minus debts)
- [ ] Calculate each party's share (50% in community property; equitable % in equitable distribution states)
- [ ] Propose division structures (Options 1-4 above)
- [ ] Calculate equalization payment (if values unequal)
- [ ] Consider tax implications (after-tax values)
- [ ] Draft property division spreadsheet (all assets, debts, to whom)
- [ ] QDROs identified (which accounts need QDROs?)
- [ ] Refinance requirements (which debts need refinancing?)
- [ ] Asset transfer deadlines (30-90 days typical)

## Summary

**Fair division means:**
1. **Complete inventory** (all assets, all debts)
2. **Accurate characterization** (community vs. separate; burden of proof on claiming separate)
3. **Current valuation** (appraisals, statements, expert opinions)
4. **Equal division** (community property states) or **equitable division** (equitable distribution states)
5. **Tax consideration** (after-tax values, not just face values)
6. **Enforcement mechanisms** (QDROs, refinance requirements, deadlines)
