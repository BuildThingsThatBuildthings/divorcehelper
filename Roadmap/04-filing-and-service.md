# Stage 4: Filing & Service

*Written by: Legal Navigator Agent*

## Overview

Filing and service marks the official start of your divorce case. This stage transforms your private decision into a legal proceeding with court involvement, formal deadlines, and immediate consequences.

**What Filing Means:**
- Official record that divorce is happening
- Court assigns case number
- Legal process begins with timeline and deadlines
- Public record (unless sealed for special reasons)
- Triggers automatic restraining orders in some jurisdictions

**What Service Means:**
- Legal notification to your spouse that case has been filed
- Starts the clock for spouse to respond
- Required for court to have jurisdiction over spouse
- Must be done properly or case can be dismissed

**Why This Stage Matters:**
- Sets everything in motion legally
- Automatic orders may immediately restrict certain actions
- Response deadline determines timeline
- Proper service is critical for case to proceed
- Mistakes at this stage can delay entire case

**Timeline:** Filing takes 1 day. Service typically completed within 30-60 days. Response due 20-30 days after service (varies by state).

## Part A: Filing the Petition

### What Is a Petition (Complaint)?

The **Petition for Dissolution of Marriage** (called "Complaint" in some states) is the legal document that starts your divorce case. It tells the court and your spouse:
- You want a divorce
- Grounds for divorce (reason)
- What you're asking for (custody, support, property division)
- Basic information about marriage, children, assets

**Key sections typically include:**
1. **Parties**: Your name, spouse's name, addresses
2. **Jurisdiction**: Why this court has authority (residency requirements)
3. **Marriage information**: Date married, date separated
4. **Children**: Names, ages, dates of birth
5. **Grounds**: Legal reason for divorce (most states: irreconcilable differences)
6. **Relief requested**: What you want court to order
   - Child custody and parenting time
   - Child support
   - Spousal support
   - Property division
   - Attorney's fees
   - Name change
7. **Property**: General description of assets and debts

**Important:** Petition sets outer boundaries of what you can ask for. You can ask for less later, but typically can't ask for more without amending petition.

### Venue: Where to File

**General rule**: File in the county where you or your spouse currently reside.

**Residency requirements** (varies by state):
- Typically must be resident of STATE for 6 months to 1 year
- Typically must be resident of COUNTY for shorter period (30-90 days)
- Military personnel may have special rules
- If you just moved, you may not meet residency yet

**Example (California)**:
- Resident of California for at least 6 months
- Resident of county for at least 3 months
- If don't meet county requirement, can file in county where spouse meets requirement

**Multiple possible venues:**
If both spouses live in different counties in same state:
- Can file in your county of residence OR
- Can file in spouse's county of residence
- Strategic considerations (which court is faster, which judge, distance for hearings)

**If spouse lives in different state:**
- Usually file where you live (if meet residency requirements)
- May have jurisdictional issues if spouse challenges
- Consult attorney about complicated jurisdiction scenarios

### Required Forms

**Forms vary significantly by state.** Most states have standardized forms.

**Typical forms for initial filing:**

1. **Petition/Complaint for Dissolution** (main document)
2. **Summons** (official notice to spouse)
3. **Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJEA)** (if children)
   - Where child has lived past 5 years
   - Any other custody cases
   - People with custody or visitation rights
4. **Financial Declarations/Affidavit** (some states require at filing, others later)
5. **Cover sheet** (administrative info for court)
6. **Filing fee** (check, money order, or credit card)

**Where to get forms:**
- Court website (most courts have downloadable forms)
- Court clerk's office (physical copies)
- Legal aid organizations
- Attorney will prepare if you're represented

**Completing forms:**
- Type or print clearly in black ink
- Must be truthful and accurate (you'll sign under penalty of perjury)
- Complete all required fields
- Include all children, all assets/debts (general description, specifics come later)
- Check local rules for specific requirements

### Filing Fee

**Cost:** $200-500 typically (varies by state and county)

**Fee waiver** available if low income:
- File request for waiver with financial declaration
- Court reviews income/assets
- If approved, don't pay fee
- Eligibility typically: income below ~150-200% federal poverty level OR receiving public benefits

**Where to file:**
- Clerk's office at courthouse (in person)
- By mail (if court allows)
- Electronic filing (if court has e-filing system)

**What you get when you file:**
- Case number assigned
- Filed-stamped copies of petition (get multiple copies)
- Summons issued
- Date filed (important for timeline calculations)

### What Happens When You File

**Immediate effects:**

1. **Case is officially open**
   - Public record (unless sealed)
   - Case number assigned
   - Court has jurisdiction

2. **Automatic Temporary Restraining Orders take effect** (in some states)
   - California: ATROs take effect immediately upon filing
   - Other states: May issue temporary orders upon filing or service
   - See ATRO section below for what's prohibited

3. **Clock starts for mandatory waiting periods**
   - California: 6 months from date spouse is served before divorce can be finalized
   - Other states: Varies (some have no waiting period, others have 30-90 days)

4. **You become "Petitioner"**
   - Your spouse becomes "Respondent"
   - These labels stay throughout case

5. **Disclosure obligations begin**
   - Duty to preserve evidence
   - Financial disclosure requirements triggered

**What doesn't happen:**
- No immediate custody changes (unless emergency order requested)
- No immediate property changes (unless emergency order requested)
- Nothing changes until spouse is served and orders are issued

### Strategic Considerations in Filing

**Who files first?**

Advantages of filing first:
- You're petitioner (slight psychological advantage)
- You control timing
- You choose venue (if multiple options)
- You present your case first (in some hearings)
- Automatic restraining orders may take effect on filing (protecting you from spouse's actions)

Disadvantages of filing first:
- You show your hand first
- Costs of filing and serving
- May appear more adversarial if trying to preserve relationship

**When to file?**

Consider timing:
- Tax year implications (married as of Dec 31 = must file married status)
- Employment/income changes (support calculated on current income)
- Property values (market changes)
- Children's school year (minimize disruption)
- Your readiness (emotional, financial, logistical)
- Spouse's likely reaction

**What to request in petition?**

Be careful not to under-request:
- Request full range of relief you might want
- Can narrow later, but harder to expand
- Don't request things purely for spite (looks bad)
- Be reasonable (courts disregard obviously unreasonable requests)

Example: If you might want spousal support, request it in petition even if unsure. You can always waive it later. But if you don't request it, may be difficult to add later.

---

## Part B: Service of Process

### What Is Service?

**Service of process** = legal delivery of divorce papers to your spouse. This officially notifies them of the case and gives them opportunity to respond.

**Why required:**
- Constitutional right: due process requires notice
- Court needs jurisdiction over both parties
- Starts spouse's deadline to respond
- Proves spouse was notified (if they later claim they didn't know)

**When it happens:**
- After petition is filed
- Usually within 30-60 days of filing (most states require service within certain timeframe)

### Who Can Serve

**Generally, anyone 18+ who is NOT a party to the case can serve.**

**Options:**

1. **Professional Process Server** ($50-200 typically)
   - Most common method
   - Experienced in locating people
   - Knows legal requirements
   - Will provide proof of service
   - Recommended

2. **Sheriff or Marshal** ($40-100 typically)
   - Official capacity
   - Authority to serve
   - May be slower than private process server
   - Useful if spouse might be hostile

3. **Friend or Relative** (Free, but not ideal)
   - Must be 18+
   - Must NOT be party to case (can't be you)
   - Must be willing to testify if service challenged
   - Must complete proof of service correctly
   - Not recommended for hostile cases

**YOU CANNOT SERVE YOUR OWN DIVORCE PAPERS**
- Must be someone else
- Even if you're on friendly terms
- Legal requirement

### Methods of Service

**Personal Service** (Most common, required in most states initially):
- Server physically hands papers to spouse
- Can be at home, work, public place
- Must identify correct person
- Spouse doesn't have to "accept" - can drop papers at their feet if they refuse
- Most legally secure method

**Substituted Service** (If personal service not possible):
- Leave papers with someone at spouse's home or workplace
- Requirements:
  - Must attempt personal service first (several attempts)
  - Person receiving must be suitable age/discretion
  - Must also mail copy to spouse
  - Timing requirements (often service not complete until X days after mailing)

**Service by Mail** (If allowed in your state):
- Certified mail, return receipt requested
- Must sign for certified mail
- If spouse refuses to sign, doesn't count as service in most states
- Some states allow mail service with acknowledgment of receipt

**Service by Publication** (Last resort):
- When spouse cannot be located despite diligent search
- Must show court you tried everything else (skip trace, relatives, last known addresses, etc.)
- Publish notice in newspaper for required period (4 weeks typically)
- Expensive and time-consuming
- May limit what court can order (property division may be restricted)

**Service in Another State**:
- Can use process server in state where spouse lives
- Must follow rules of state where spouse is located
- More complicated, may need local counsel

**Service in Another Country**:
- Very complex, involves international treaties (Hague Convention)
- May need translation
- Significantly delays case
- Attorney absolutely necessary

### Proof of Service

After spouse is served, server must complete **Proof of Service** form and file it with court.

**Information required:**
- Who was served
- Date and time of service
- Location of service
- Method of service
- Description of person served (to verify identity)
- Server's signature under penalty of perjury

**Filing Proof of Service:**
- CRITICAL - must be filed with court
- Without it, court doesn't know spouse was served
- Can't proceed with case until proof filed
- Server usually files it, but verify it was done

**Timeline:**
- Proof must be filed before any hearings
- Some states require filing within X days of service
- Don't delay - file immediately after service

### What If Spouse Evades Service?

**Common evasion tactics:**
- Refusing to answer door
- Hiding from process server
- Staying at friend's/family's house
- Moving without forwarding address
- Instructing workplace not to allow service

**Solutions:**

1. **Try multiple times at different times/days**
   - Early morning (before work)
   - Evening (after work)
   - Weekends
   - Vary the pattern

2. **Serve at work** (if allowed in your jurisdiction)
   - Often can't evade at workplace
   - Check if employer allows service on premises
   - May be embarrassing to spouse (use strategically)

3. **Serve at locations spouse frequents**
   - Gym, church, regular social locations
   - Public places are fine
   - Can't trespass to serve

4. **Substituted service** (after several attempts at personal service fail)
   - Serve roommate/family member at home
   - Mail copy to spouse
   - Declare attempts under penalty of perjury

5. **Service by publication** (last resort)
   - Court must approve
   - Must show diligent search efforts
   - Publish in newspaper
   - Expensive

### Spouse's Voluntary Acceptance of Service

If spouse is cooperative, can **waive formal service**:

**Acknowledgment of Receipt** (varies by state name):
- Spouse signs form acknowledging they received papers
- Must be signed in front of notary
- File original with court
- Saves time and money
- Both parties must consent

**Benefits:**
- No process server needed
- No fee
- No embarrassment of being served
- Faster

**Risks:**
- Spouse may delay signing
- Spouse may "forget" they agreed
- Less legally secure if spouse later challenges

**Only use if:**
- Spouse is truly cooperative
- You trust them to follow through
- They sign promptly
- Attorney approves

## Part C: Automatic Temporary Restraining Orders (ATROs)

### What Are ATROs?

In some states (California is prime example), **Automatic Temporary Restraining Orders** take effect immediately upon service of divorce papers. They restrict both parties from taking certain actions during the divorce case.

**Purpose:**
- Maintain status quo
- Prevent dissipation of assets
- Protect children from relocation
- Ensure insurance coverage continues
- Level playing field between parties

**When they take effect:**
- California: Upon service (for Respondent) and upon filing (for Petitioner)
- Other states: Varies - some have similar automatic orders, others require court to issue orders

**Who they apply to:**
- BOTH parties
- Even if only one party filed
- Even if you didn't agree to them
- They are AUTOMATIC - not optional

**Duration:**
- Remain in effect until final judgment
- OR until modified by court order
- OR until settlement agreement

### What ATROs Typically Prohibit

**California Family Code §2040** is the model. Even if you're not in California, many states have similar provisions.

**CANNOT do (without written consent of other party OR court order):**

1. **Remove children from California** (or state where case filed)
   - No taking kids out of state for vacation, to move, etc.
   - Without other parent's written consent OR court permission
   - Emergency exceptions (medical care, etc.)

2. **Transfer, encumber, hypothecate, conceal, or dispose of any property** (with exceptions)
   - Can't sell house
   - Can't sell cars
   - Can't transfer bank account funds (beyond ordinary expenses)
   - Can't sell investments
   - Can't give away property
   - Can't borrow against property (HELOC, etc.)

3. **Cash, borrow against, cancel, transfer, dispose of, or change beneficiaries of insurance policies**
   - Life insurance beneficiaries must stay same
   - Health insurance must be maintained
   - Can't cancel policies
   - Can't cash out cash value life insurance
   - Can't borrow against policies

4. **Create or modify nonprobate transfers** (transfer on death deeds, payable on death accounts, etc.)
   - Can't change TOD/POD beneficiaries
   - Can't create new nonprobate transfers

5. **Change beneficiary designations on retirement accounts** (401k, IRA, etc.)
   - Must maintain current beneficiaries
   - Prevents removing spouse before division

**CAN still do (exceptions):**
- Use property for "necessities of life"
- Pay reasonable attorney's fees
- In usual course of business or financial affairs
- Pay for required court fees and costs

### What ATROs Allow

**You CAN:**
- Pay bills
- Buy groceries
- Pay mortgage/rent
- Pay utilities
- Pay children's expenses (school, activities, medical)
- Earn income and deposit to accounts
- Hire attorney and pay attorney fees
- Maintain property (repairs)
- Continue business operations normally
- Use credit cards for ordinary expenses

**You CANNOT:**
- Empty bank accounts
- Make large purchases (new car, boat, etc.)
- Sell house or other major assets
- Transfer money to family members
- Cancel insurance
- Change beneficiaries
- Take children out of state
- Incur large new debts (not necessities)

### Consequences of Violating ATROs

**Very serious:**
- Court can impose sanctions
- Reimburse dissipated funds to community
- Award attorney's fees to other party
- Hold you in contempt
- Criminal penalties possible
- **Loss of credibility** with judge (devastating)

**Example violations:**
- Sold car worth $30,000 → Court orders you to pay $30,000 to marital estate plus spouse's attorney fees
- Took children to Mexico without consent → Court gives sole custody to other parent, you held in contempt
- Canceled spouse's health insurance → Court orders you to pay all medical expenses plus reimburse, plus attorney's fees

**Even "innocent" violations have consequences:**
- "I didn't know" is not an excuse - you're presumed to know the law
- Ignorance doesn't protect you

### If You Need to Do Something Restricted

**Two options:**

1. **Get written consent from spouse**
   - Ask in writing (text, email)
   - Get written confirmation
   - Keep documentation
   - Still somewhat risky if spouse later denies

2. **Ask court for permission** (safer)
   - File motion (Request for Order)
   - Explain why you need to do X
   - Court will hold hearing
   - Get court order permitting
   - Follow order exactly

**Examples when you'd need court order:**
- Sell marital home (need to move, can't afford)
- Withdraw retirement funds for emergency
- Move with children to another state for job
- Cancel insurance policy (too expensive, better option available)

### Other States' Automatic Orders

**Not all states have automatic restraining orders like California.** Check your jurisdiction.

**States with similar automatic orders:**
- Texas (standing orders in some counties)
- Florida (injunctions upon service)
- New York (automatic orders in some counties)
- Arizona (preliminary injunctions)

**States without automatic orders:**
- Many states require you to REQUEST temporary orders
- Nothing automatic happens upon filing/service
- Until court issues orders, no restrictions
- BUT: Still have duty not to dissipate assets (court can sanction later)

**How to find out:**
- Ask attorney
- Check local court rules
- Look at summons (often lists automatic orders if applicable)
- Court website FAQs

---

## Part D: Respondent's Options After Being Served

### What Happens When Spouse Is Served

Your spouse receives:
- Petition/Complaint
- Summons (official notice from court)
- Any declarations or attachments you filed
- ATRO notice (if applicable)

**They have several options:**

### Option 1: File Response (Most Common)

**Response** (also called "Answer" in some states) is spouse's official reply to your petition.

**What Response includes:**
- Admit or deny allegations in petition
- State their own requests (custody, support, property division, attorney fees)
- Raise defenses (though few defenses to no-fault divorce)
- Counter-petition (if they have different requests)

**Timeline for Response:**
- Typically 20-30 days from date of service
- California: 30 days
- Can request extension from court (usually granted once if good cause)

**What if spouse disagrees with petition?**
- That's expected - you're divorcing
- Response is where they state their position
- Doesn't mean you go to trial - 90%+ still settle
- Just means they're participating and have different views

**If Respondent files Response:**
- Case proceeds as contested
- Discovery can begin
- Temporary orders hearing scheduled
- Settlement negotiations begin
- Both parties involved in process

### Option 2: Default (No Response)

If spouse does NOT file response within deadline:
- You can request **default**
- Court enters judgment based on your petition
- Spouse loses right to contest

**Default process:**
1. Wait until response deadline passes
2. File Request for Entry of Default with court
3. Clerk enters default
4. File for default judgment (prove your case with declarations)
5. Court issues judgment based on what you requested

**When defaults happen:**
- Spouse agrees with everything and doesn't want to participate
- Spouse is avoiding case
- Spouse cannot be located (served by publication)
- Spouse doesn't care/is not engaged

**Benefits of default (for Petitioner):**
- Faster resolution
- Less conflict
- Lower cost (no litigation)
- You get what you requested (within reason)

**Risks:**
- Spouse can try to set aside default later (limited circumstances)
- May not address all issues thoroughly
- Spouse may claim they didn't understand consequences

**Important:** Even with default, court still must approve. Can't get unreasonable orders. Must still prove you're entitled to what you're asking for.

### Option 3: Do Nothing and Hope It Goes Away (Bad Idea)

**What happens:**
- Eventually you file for default
- Spouse loses all rights to participate
- Judgment entered without their input
- Very difficult to set aside later

**Why people do this (wrongly):**
- Fear/avoidance
- Don't think divorce is "real"
- Think ignoring it will make it go away
- Don't understand consequences
- Can't afford attorney (should still file response or seek legal aid)

**Why it's terrible strategy:**
- Lose all control over outcome
- Spouse gets what they asked for (usually)
- No say in custody, support, property
- Very expensive to try to fix later
- Judges unsympathetic to "I ignored it"

### Option 4: Contest Service (Rare)

If service was improper, spouse can challenge:
- File motion to quash service
- Argue they were never properly served
- If successful, you must serve again correctly

**Rarely successful unless:**
- Proof of service is clearly wrong (served wrong person)
- Didn't follow proper procedures
- Service in wrong state/country

**Most challenges fail** - courts favor upholding service if reasonably proper.

### Option 5: File Counter-Petition (Common)

**Counter-petition** is Respondent's request for divorce with their own terms.

**When used:**
- Respondent wants different orders than Petition requests
- Respondent wants to be seen as proactive (not just reacting)
- Strategic positioning

**Content:**
- Mirror image of Petition, but with Respondent's requests
- Both Petition and Counter-Petition proceed simultaneously
- Court will resolve all requests (from both) at same time

**Doesn't change much:**
- Case proceeds as contested
- Both parties are now "Petitioner on Counter-Petition"
- Still settle in vast majority of cases
- Just gives both parties equal procedural footing

---

## Part E: After Service - What Comes Next

### Immediate Timeline After Service

**Day 0:** Spouse served
**Day 1-30:** Respondent's deadline to file Response (varies by state)
**Day 30-45:** If no Response, Petitioner can file for Default
**Day 30-60:** If Response filed, case proceeds as contested

**Next steps (contested case):**
1. **Temporary orders hearing** (usually within 30-90 days)
2. **Financial disclosures** exchanged (typically 60-90 days)
3. **Discovery** begins (interrogatories, document requests, depositions)
4. **Settlement discussions** (ongoing)
5. **Mediation** (often required by court)
6. **Trial** (if no settlement, typically 12-18+ months out)

### Temporary Orders Hearing

**Why needed:**
- Case will take months or years
- Need orders to govern during that time
- Who has custody temporarily?
- Who pays bills?
- Who lives in house?
- Temporary support?

**Process:**
- Either party files Request for Order (RFO)
- Other party files response
- Short hearing (15-30 minutes typically)
- Judge issues temporary orders
- Orders remain in effect until final judgment or modification

**Common temporary orders:**
- Temporary custody schedule
- Temporary child support (often based on guideline)
- Temporary spousal support
- Who stays in family home
- Who pays what bills/debts
- Status quo financial orders (maintain accounts, no dissipation)

**Temporary ≠ Final:**
- Temporary orders are just that - temporary
- Still negotiate/litigate final orders
- But temporary orders often influence final (inertia/status quo)

### Disclosure Requirements Begin

Once case filed and served:
- Both parties have duty to disclose finances completely
- Mandatory disclosure deadlines (varies by state, typically 60-90 days)
- Informal discovery can begin
- Preservation of evidence duty applies to both parties

See Stage 6 for detailed disclosure requirements.

### Settlement Discussions

- Can begin immediately, even before Response filed
- Mediation (private or court-ordered)
- Informal negotiations between attorneys
- Four-way meetings
- Settlement conferences

Goal: Resolve without trial (90%+ do settle eventually)

## Red Flags & Common Problems

### Can't Locate Spouse

**Problem:** Don't know where spouse is living/working.

**Solutions:**
1. Skip trace services (find people)
2. Hire private investigator
3. Try social media, mutual friends (carefully)
4. Check last known addresses
5. Check with relatives
6. DMV records (through attorney)
7. Voter registration
8. Property records
9. Ultimately: Service by publication (with court approval)

**Timeline impact:** Significantly delays case if can't locate. Service by publication adds 4-6 weeks minimum.

### Spouse Becomes Hostile/Dangerous After Service

**Problem:** Serving papers triggers violence or threats.

**Solutions:**
1. File for restraining order immediately
2. Go to safe location
3. Document all threats
4. Contact police if threatened
5. Inform attorney immediately
6. Consider safety plan (see Stage 1)

**Prevention:** If you anticipated hostile reaction, should have had safety plan BEFORE serving.

### Spouse Claims They Were Never Served

**Problem:** Spouse says they never received papers, challenges service.

**Solutions:**
1. Proof of service should be solid (this is why professional process servers are best)
2. Process server can testify if needed
3. Court usually upholds proper service
4. If service was defective, must re-serve correctly

**Prevention:** Use professional process server, follow procedures exactly, get detailed proof of service.

### Defective Service

**Problem:** Service wasn't done correctly (wrong person, wrong method, didn't follow rules).

**Solutions:**
1. Spouse files motion to quash
2. If granted, must serve again correctly
3. Delays case

**Prevention:** Follow your state's rules exactly, use professional, get legal guidance.

### Service in Foreign Country

**Problem:** Spouse is in another country.

**Solutions:**
1. Very complex - Hague Convention requirements
2. May need to translate documents
3. Significantly delays case (months)
4. Expensive
5. Attorney absolutely necessary
6. May affect what court can order (property division may be limited)

### Spouse Refuses to Sign for Certified Mail

**Problem:** If service by mail requires signature, spouse refuses.

**Solutions:**
1. Doesn't count as service in most states
2. Must use different method (personal service, substituted)
3. Can't force spouse to accept service by mail

**Don't rely on mail service if spouse is uncooperative.**

### Process Server Can't Access Gated Community

**Problem:** Spouse lives in gated community, guard won't allow server entry.

**Solutions:**
1. Serve at work instead
2. Serve at location outside community
3. Wait for spouse to leave (server follows)
4. Mail copy + personal service attempt (substituted service)

### Spouse Works from Home, Never Leaves

**Problem:** Can't catch spouse outside to serve.

**Solutions:**
1. Early morning attempts (before they expect)
2. Creative locations (if they ever leave for groceries, etc.)
3. Substituted service after multiple attempts
4. May need to hire investigator to find pattern
