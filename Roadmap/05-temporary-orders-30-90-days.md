# Stage 5: Temporary Orders (30-90 Days)

*Written by: Court & Compliance Agent + Co-Parenting Agent*

## Overview

Temporary orders govern your lives during the divorce process - which can take 6-24+ months. These court orders establish custody, support, property use, and financial obligations while the case is pending. They create structure, predictability, and legal enforceability during what is often the most chaotic and uncertain time.

**What Temporary Orders Are:**
- Court orders effective during divorce pendency (from issuance until final judgment)
- NOT final - still subject to negotiation or trial for final orders
- BUT very important - often influence final outcome (inertia/status quo)
- Legally binding and enforceable (contempt sanctions if violated)

**Why Temporary Orders Matter:**
- Your case will take months or years to finalize
- Need immediate answers: Who has kids? Who pays bills? Who lives where?
- Prevent chaos and unilateral decisions
- Protect children's stability
- Maintain financial status quo
- Provide roadmap until final resolution

**Who Can Request:**
- Either party can request temporary orders
- Often Petitioner requests at time of filing
- Respondent can request in their Response or separate motion

**Timeline:**
- Hearing typically scheduled 30-90 days after request filed
- Some jurisdictions: Emergency/ex parte orders possible (within days if showing urgent need)
- Orders remain in effect until final judgment or modified

# PART A: UNDERSTANDING TEMPORARY ORDERS

*From: Court & Compliance Agent*

## Types of Court Orders

### Ex Parte Orders (Emergency, Temporary)

**What:** Emergency orders issued without both parties present.

**When used:**
- True emergencies requiring immediate relief
- Domestic violence/restraining orders
- Child abduction risk
- Immediate threat to assets
- Cannot wait for regular hearing

**Process:**
1. File ex parte application showing emergency
2. Must show immediate harm/irreparable injury
3. Judge reviews same day or next day
4. Hearing scheduled within 10-20 days (both parties present)
5. Order effective immediately but short-term

**Standard:** HIGH - must show genuine emergency, not just urgency.

**Example:** Spouse is about to flee country with children → Ex parte order preventing travel, requiring passport surrender.

**NOT emergencies:**
- "I need support payments" (file regular motion)
- "We can't agree on custody schedule" (file regular motion)
- "Spouse spent money" (unless draining all accounts right now)

### Temporary Orders (Pendente Lite)

**What:** Orders effective during pendency of divorce case.

**When used:** Most divorce cases - standard procedure to establish baseline rules during case.

**Process:**
1. Party files Request for Order (RFO) or Motion
2. Other party receives papers (typically 16-30 days before hearing)
3. Other party files response
4. Both submit evidence (declarations, financial documents)
5. Short hearing (15-60 minutes typically)
6. Judge issues oral or written order
7. Order effective immediately (or date specified)

**Duration:** Until final judgment or until modified by subsequent order.

**Standard:** Lower than trial - judge makes quick decision based on declarations (written testimony), not full trial with witnesses.

### Permanent Orders (Final Judgment)

**What:** Final resolution of all divorce issues.

**Distinction from temporary:**
- Temporary = during case
- Permanent = after final judgment
- Final orders much harder to modify later
- Require full hearing/trial or settlement agreement

---

## Common Temporary Orders

### 1. Temporary Custody & Parenting Time

**What court orders:**
- **Legal custody**: Who makes major decisions (education, healthcare, religious upbringing)
  - Sole legal custody (one parent decides)
  - Joint legal custody (both parents decide together)
- **Physical custody**: Where child primarily lives
  - Primary physical custody (mostly with one parent)
  - Joint physical custody (relatively equal time)
- **Parenting time schedule**: Specific days/times with each parent
  - Weekday/weekend pattern
  - Exchanges (time, place)
  - Holidays (if hearing before holidays)

**What court considers** (best interests, even temporarily):
- Status quo (current arrangement)
- Primary caregiver historically
- Children's ages and needs
- Each parent's work schedule
- School/activity stability
- Geographic proximity
- Any safety concerns
- Children's preference (if age-appropriate)

**Practical reality:**
- **Status quo heavily favored** - if child living with you, likely continues
- Major changes require strong showing of necessity
- Court wants stability during uncertain time
- Minimal disruption to children's routines

**Example orders:**
- "Mother shall have primary physical custody. Father shall have parenting time every other weekend Friday 6pm - Sunday 6pm, and Wednesday evenings 5pm-8pm."
- "Parents shall share joint legal custody. For temporary orders, Mother shall have tie-breaking authority on medical decisions given her medical background."

### 2. Temporary Child Support

**What court orders:**
- Amount of monthly child support
- Due date (typically 1st or 15th of month, or biweekly)
- Payment method (direct, through state agency, wage garnishment)
- Who pays health insurance
- How medical expenses shared

**How calculated:**
- **State guideline formula** (mandatory starting point)
- Input: Each parent's gross income
- Input: % of parenting time
- Input: Health insurance cost
- Input: Childcare/work-related expenses
- Output: Guideline support amount

**Court can deviate from guideline but must explain why.**

**Practical reality:**
- Very formulaic - plug numbers into calculator
- Judge follows guideline in vast majority of cases
- Based on CURRENT income (if you just lost job, affects calculation)
- Temporary support often becomes final support (or very close)

**Example order:**
- "Father shall pay Mother child support in the amount of $1,500 per month, due on the 1st of each month, payable through the State Disbursement Unit."

### 3. Temporary Spousal Support (Alimony/Maintenance)

**What court orders:**
- Amount of monthly spousal support
- Duration (temporary - until final judgment)
- Payment method

**How determined:**
- More discretionary than child support
- Factors: Length of marriage, income disparity, standard of living, age/health, earning capacity
- Some states have temporary support formulas (e.g., CA: Santa Clara guideline formula)
- Other states: Judge's discretion based on need and ability to pay

**Practical reality:**
- Temporary support often uses formula (if state has one)
- Much quicker analysis than final support determination
- Based on need to maintain status quo
- Final support may differ (more analysis of earning capacity, duration)

**Example order:**
- "Husband shall pay Wife spousal support in the amount of $3,000 per month, payable on the 1st of each month."

### 4. Exclusive Use of Family Home

**What court orders:**
- Who stays in marital home during case
- Who moves out (if anyone)
- Who pays mortgage, property tax, insurance
- Who pays utilities, maintenance

**What court considers:**
- Where children are (primary custodial parent usually stays)
- Who can afford to move out
- Safety concerns (DV victim should stay, abuser should leave)
- Ownership (rental vs owned)
- Practical considerations (work proximity, school district)

**Practical reality:**
- Parent with primary custody usually gets home
- If no kids or equal time, often status quo (whoever's there stays)
- Doesn't determine final property division (who gets home in settlement)

**Example order:**
- "Wife shall have exclusive use and possession of the family residence at 123 Main St. Husband shall vacate by [date]. Wife shall pay the mortgage, property taxes, insurance, and utilities."

### 5. Vehicle Use

**What court orders:**
- Who drives which vehicle(s)
- Who pays loan, insurance, registration
- Who maintains vehicle

**Practical considerations:**
- Each party needs transportation typically
- One vehicle per person if two vehicles
- If one vehicle, usually custodial parent gets it (child transportation)

**Example order:**
- "Wife shall have use of the 2020 Honda Odyssey. Husband shall have use of the 2018 Toyota Camry. Each party shall pay the loan, insurance, and maintenance for the vehicle they drive."

### 6. Payment of Bills and Debts

**What court orders:**
- Who pays what bills/debts during case
- Credit card payments
- Loan payments
- Utilities
- Children's expenses

**How determined:**
- Income disparity
- Who incurs expense
- Status quo (who paid before)
- Fairness

**Practical reality:**
- Each party typically pays their own living expenses
- Marital debts often split based on income proportion
- Children's expenses covered by child support (or split separately)

**Example order:**
- "Husband shall pay the mortgage and property taxes. Wife shall pay the utilities. Each party shall pay their own credit cards. Husband shall pay 60% and Wife shall pay 40% of children's unreimbursed medical expenses."

### 7. Status Quo Financial Orders

**What court orders:**
- Maintain joint accounts (don't drain)
- No selling assets without agreement or court order
- No borrowing against assets
- Continue insurance (health, life)
- No changing beneficiaries
- Provide financial accountings

**Purpose:** Preserve marital estate, prevent dissipation.

**Similar to ATROs** (if your state has those), but court-ordered here.

**Example order:**
- "Neither party shall withdraw more than $500 per month from joint accounts without written consent of other party or court order. Each party shall maintain existing life insurance policies with current beneficiaries."

### 8. Attorney's Fees (Sometimes)

**What court orders:**
- One party pay other party's attorney fees (temporary contribution)

**When ordered:**
- Significant income disparity
- One party cannot afford attorney
- Ensure equal access to legal process

**Standard:** Need + ability to pay

**Example order:**
- "Husband shall pay $5,000 toward Wife's attorney fees within 30 days."

## Understanding Your Temporary Order

### Reading Court Orders - Key Elements

**1. Parties:** Who the order applies to (you and spouse)

**2. Effective Date:** When does order take effect?
- Usually immediately after hearing
- Sometimes specific date stated
- Sometimes "upon signing" (when judge signs written order)

**3. Duration:** How long does order last?
- "Until further order of the court" = until modified or final judgment
- Sometimes specific end date

**4. Affirmative Requirements:** What you MUST do
- Pay support
- Provide documents
- Attend parenting classes
- Make children available for parenting time
- Maintain insurance
- Pay specific bills

**Look for:** "SHALL" = mandatory requirement

**5. Prohibitions:** What you MUST NOT do
- Don't move with children out of state
- Don't dissipate assets
- Don't cancel insurance
- Don't change beneficiaries
- Don't make major purchases

**Look for:** "IS RESTRAINED" or "SHALL NOT" = prohibition

**6. Deadlines:** By when must things be done?
- Support due dates (1st of month, 15th of month, etc.)
- Document production deadlines
- Compliance action deadlines

**Look for:** "WITHIN [X] DAYS" or specific dates

**7. Consequences:** What happens if you don't comply?
- Sometimes stated explicitly
- Always implied: Contempt, sanctions, attorney fees

---

## Compliance is CRITICAL

### Why Temporary Orders Compliance Matters

**1. Legal Obligation:**
- Court orders are binding
- Violation = contempt of court
- Can result in fines, jail time, attorney fees

**2. Credibility:**
- Judge is watching
- Compliance shows you respect court and follow rules
- Non-compliance destroys your credibility for final orders
- Judge will remember you ignored temporary orders

**3. Setting Precedent:**
- How you act during temporary orders shows how you'll act after final
- If you can't follow temporary custody order, why would judge give you more custody in final?

**4. Establishing Pattern:**
- Temporary orders often influence final orders
- If temporary custody works well, likely becomes final
- If you're reliable with temporary support, positions you well

**5. Enforcement:**
- Other party can file contempt motion
- Can lose custody/parenting time
- Can have wages garnished
- Can have driver's license suspended (for support)
- Can face jail time

### How to Comply

**Child Support:**
- Pay EXACT amount ordered
- Pay by deadline specified (don't be late even one day)
- Use traceable method:
  - Check (keep copy and proof of delivery)
  - Money order (keep receipt)
  - Direct deposit (keep bank confirmation)
  - State disbursement unit (if ordered)
- NEVER pay cash (no proof)
- NEVER pay less than ordered (even if other parent "agrees")
- Keep every receipt/proof forever

**Spousal Support:**
- Same rules as child support
- Note tax treatment (post-2018 agreements = not deductible/taxable)

**Parenting Time:**
- Follow schedule exactly
- Be on time for exchanges (not 10 minutes late - ON TIME)
- Return children on time
- Have children ready with their belongings
- Don't withhold time even if other parent owes you support (separate issues)
- Document your compliance (calendar showing you exercised all time)

**Decision-Making:**
- If joint legal custody, consult other parent on major decisions
- If sole legal custody assigned to other parent, don't make unilateral major decisions
- Document your consultation attempts
- "Major decisions" typically: school enrollment, non-emergency medical, religious upbringing, extracurriculars

**Property/Financial Orders:**
- Don't violate status quo orders
- Don't sell assets without permission
- Don't drain accounts
- Pay bills you're ordered to pay
- Maintain insurance as ordered
- Don't change beneficiaries

**Documentation:**
- Keep records of every payment
- Screenshot bank transfers
- Calendar showing parenting time exercised
- Emails showing you consulted on decisions
- Proof of insurance maintained

### What to Do If You Can't Comply

**NEVER just ignore the order.**

**If you can't comply:**

**1. Communicate with Other Party (If Possible)**
- Explain situation
- Ask for accommodation
- Get written agreement if they agree
- Still risky - they can later claim breach

**2. File Motion to Modify (Better)**
- File Request for Order to modify
- Explain changed circumstances
- Request new order
- Hearing scheduled
- Judge modifies order if warranted

**Examples when you'd need modification:**
- Lost job (can't pay support at ordered amount)
- Child's needs changed (need different schedule)
- Ordered to pay bill but can't afford
- Need to move with children for job
- Medical emergency requiring different arrangement

**3. Document Why You Couldn't Comply**
- If emergency prevents compliance (e.g., hospitalized on exchange day), document
- Communicate with other party ASAP
- File declaration with court explaining
- Make up missed time/payment as soon as possible
- Show good faith effort

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't just stop complying and hope it's okay
- Don't assume other parent's "verbal agreement" protects you
- Don't think "good reason" excuses you without court approval
- Don't wait until contempt hearing to explain

# PART B: TEMPORARY PARENTING ARRANGEMENTS

*From: Co-Parenting Agent*

## Temporary vs. Final Custody

### Important Distinctions

**Temporary custody:**
- Orders in effect during divorce case
- Based on quick hearing (limited evidence)
- Focused on status quo and stability
- Easier to modify if not working

**Final custody:**
- Orders in final judgment
- Based on full trial or settlement
- Comprehensive analysis of best interests
- Harder to modify after judgment (requires changed circumstances)

**Does temporary affect final?**

**Yes - significantly:**
- **Inertia/status quo principle:** Once temporary arrangement established and working, hard to change
- **Track record:** If you're exercising all temporary parenting time well, supports more time in final
- **Child's adjustment:** If child adjusted to temporary schedule, court reluctant to disrupt
- **Default to temporary:** If no compelling reason to change, temporary often becomes final

**But NOT determinative:**
- Temporary orders are rebuttable
- Full trial provides more evidence
- Changed circumstances can justify different final orders
- Settlement can be different than temporary

**Strategic implication:** Fight for reasonable temporary custody - don't assume you'll "fix it later" at trial.

---

## What Temporary Parenting Orders Cover

### 1. Physical Custody Designation

**Primary physical custody:**
- Child lives primarily with one parent
- Other parent has "parenting time" or "visitation"
- Majority of overnights with primary parent

**Joint physical custody:**
- Relatively equal time with both parents
- Various schedules: 50/50, 60/40, 70/30 (still sometimes called "joint")
- Requires parents living in proximity, child-focused communication

**What court considers:**
- **Status quo:** Where has child been living?
- **Primary caregiver:** Who's been doing day-to-day care?
- **Stability:** Maintain child's routine during uncertain time
- **Practical logistics:** Work schedules, school location, home locations
- **Safety:** Any DV, substance abuse, neglect concerns

**Practical reality for temporary orders:**
- Court very hesitant to upend status quo
- If child living with you and doing okay, likely continues
- Major changes require strong showing of necessity
- Move-away issues (if one parent moved out of area) can complicate

### 2. Legal Custody Designation

**Sole legal custody:**
- One parent makes major decisions (education, healthcare, religious upbringing)
- Other parent has right to receive information
- Used when: High conflict, inability to communicate, safety concerns, geographic distance

**Joint legal custody:**
- Both parents make major decisions together
- Must consult and agree (or follow tie-breaking mechanism)
- Most common presumption (slight preference for joint in many states)
- Requires: Ability to communicate, cooperate, put child first

**For temporary orders:**
- Often joint legal custody UNLESS:
  - Communication completely broken down
  - One parent makes unilateral decisions already
  - Safety concerns
  - One parent clearly more qualified (special needs child, medical knowledge)
- May assign tie-breaking authority to one parent on specific issues

**Example temporary orders:**
- "Parents shall share joint legal custody. For temporary orders, Father shall have tie-breaking authority on educational decisions."

### 3. Parenting Time Schedule

**What must be specified:**
- Regular weekly schedule
- Exchange times and locations
- Holiday schedule (if order issued before holidays)
- School break schedule (if order issued before breaks)

**Common temporary schedules:**

**Every Other Weekend (Traditional):**
- Child with Parent A: Monday-Friday, alternate weekends
- Child with Parent B: Every other weekend (Fri evening - Sun evening or Mon morning)
- Weekday visit: One evening per week (e.g., Wednesday 5pm-8pm)
- Split: ~70/30 or 80/20

**2-2-3 Schedule:**
- Week 1: Parent A (Mon-Tue), Parent B (Wed-Thu), Parent A (Fri-Sun)
- Week 2: Parent B (Mon-Tue), Parent A (Wed-Thu), Parent B (Fri-Sun)
- Split: 50/50
- More transitions but no long periods away from either parent

**Alternating Weeks:**
- Week 1: All with Parent A
- Week 2: All with Parent B
- Split: 50/50
- Fewer transitions, longer stretches with each parent

**5-2 Schedule:**
- Parent A: Mon-Fri
- Parent B: Sat-Sun
- Alternates weekly (next week Parent B has Mon-Fri)
- Split: ~70/30

**Example temporary order:**
"Mother shall have parenting time every Monday and Tuesday overnight. Father shall have parenting time every Wednesday and Thursday overnight. The parents shall alternate weekends Friday after school through Monday morning before school. Exchanges shall occur at [location]."

### 4. Exchange Logistics

**Time:** Must be specific
- "6:00 PM" not "evening"
- Include buffer ("5:00 PM - 6:00 PM" allows flexibility)
- Align with child's schedule (after school, before bedtime)

**Location:** Must be specific
- Address
- Public place if high conflict (Starbucks parking lot, police station)
- School (Monday pickup, Friday return)
- Curbside at residence

**Transportation:** Who handles
- Each parent drives own leg (pickup parent drives)
- One parent does all driving (if geographic distance)
- Meet halfway

**Child's belongings:**
- Child should have essentials at both homes (reduces forgotten items)
- Specify who provides what (clothes, medications, school supplies)
- Special belongings (favorite stuffed animal) travel with child

**Example order:**
"Exchanges shall occur at the Starbucks parking lot at 123 Main Street, Anytown. The parent receiving the child shall be responsible for pickup. The parent ending their parenting time shall have the child ready curbside."

---

## Status Quo Considerations

### Why Status Quo Matters SO Much

**"Status quo" = current arrangement before court involvement**

**Courts favor status quo because:**
1. **Presumption it's working:** If child has been in this arrangement and is okay, why disrupt?
2. **Minimize disruption:** Divorce is already disruptive - don't add unnecessary changes
3. **Primary caregiver presumption:** If one parent has been primary caregiver, continue that
4. **Child's adjustment:** Child has adapted to current situation
5. **School/activities stability:** Don't uproot child from school, activities, friends
6. **Bonding:** If child bonded with one parent as primary, maintain that bond

**What establishes status quo:**
- Where child has been living (especially if significant time, e.g., 6+ months)
- Who's been doing day-to-day care (meals, homework, bedtime, appointments)
- What child's routine has been
- School enrollment
- Who's been primary decision-maker

**Strategic Implications:**

**If you're the primary caregiver:**
- Emphasize status quo
- Show child's adjustment is good
- Show you've been handling responsibilities well
- Argument: "Don't disrupt what's working"

**If you're seeking more time:**
- Harder battle at temporary stage
- Must show why status quo should change
- Evidence: You've been requesting more time and denied, you were primary caregiver before spouse took over recently, safety concerns with current arrangement, status quo was based on false pretenses
- May need to accept less favorable temporary order and build track record for final

**Example:**
Child living with Mom for 6 months since separation. Mom doing all homework help, meals, bedtime, doctor appointments. Dad seeing child alternate weekends. Dad wants 50/50 at temporary orders.

**Likely outcome:** Court continues Mom as primary, Dad gets alternate weekends plus midweek visit. Court says: "This is temporary. We don't have time for full trial. Child is doing okay with current arrangement. Final orders can address whether 50/50 is appropriate after full hearing."

**Dad's options:**
1. Accept temporary order, exercise all time reliably, document he's a great parent, request modification before final (if circumstances change) or argue for more at final trial
2. Push hard at temporary hearing - risky if judge sees him as disrupting stability

---

## Creating Workable Temporary Schedules

### Age-Appropriate Considerations (Even for Temporary)

**Infants (0-12 months):**
- Frequent, shorter visits with non-primary parent
- Build bonding time
- Consider breastfeeding (if applicable)
- Minimize time away from primary caregiver
- Overnights may not be appropriate yet (depends on case)

**Toddlers (1-3 years):**
- Still need frequent contact with both parents
- Can handle short overnights
- Consistency in routine critical (bedtime, meals)
- Same caregiver for significant periods

**Preschool (3-5 years):**
- 2-2-3 or similar schedule can work
- Overnights regularly
- Consistency still very important

**School-Age (6-11 years):**
- Various schedules work
- Consider school proximity (who lives near school)
- Homework help needs
- Activities schedule

**Teens (12-18 years):**
- More flexibility for their social life
- Input weighted more heavily
- May have preferences
- Still need both parents

**Temporary reality:** Court doesn't do full developmental analysis at temporary hearing. If age-specific concerns (infant, special needs), must highlight strongly.

### School & Activity Considerations

**School location:** CRITICAL
- If parents live in different school districts: child usually stays with parent in current school district (maintain status quo)
- Midweek transitions difficult if school in between homes
- Transportation logistics

**Activities:**
- Soccer practice Tuesday/Thursday 5-7pm → affects who has those evenings
- Music lessons Saturdays → affects weekend schedule
- Religious activities → may influence who has what time

**Homework:**
- Elementary/middle school: Significant homework help needed
- Consider which parent can provide
- If joint schedule, must coordinate

**Temporary orders may be imperfect for logistics** - court focused on big picture (time with each parent) not perfecting around every activity. Final orders can be more tailored.

---

## Communication During Temporary Orders Phase

### BINF Communication Framework

When communicating with your co-parent during this phase, use **BINF**:

**Brief:**
- Keep messages short
- One topic per message
- Don't rehash past grievances
- Get to the point

**Example:**
✅ "Emma has soccer practice Thursday at 5pm. Can you take her or should I?"
❌ "I know you never want to help with Emma's activities like you promised when we got married, but she has soccer Thursday at 5pm and I need to know if you're going to step up for once or if I have to handle everything as usual..."

**Informative:**
- Stick to facts
- Provide necessary information
- Child-focused content only
- No emotional manipulation

**Example:**
✅ "Jake's teacher said he needs extra math help. I'm arranging a tutor for Tuesdays. Cost is $40/week. Can we split it?"
❌ "Jake is failing math because you don't help him with homework. If you cared about your son you'd notice these things."

**Neutral:**
- No blame
- No insults
- No sarcasm
- Professional tone (like business correspondence)
- Assume judge will read it (because they might)

**Example:**
✅ "I can't do the 6pm exchange Friday due to work obligation. Can we move to 7pm or would Saturday morning work better?"
❌ "You're making my life impossible with these ridiculous exchange times. I have a REAL job unlike you. We're changing to 7pm."

**Firm:**
- Clear boundaries
- Assert needs calmly
- Stand your ground on important issues
- No passive-aggressive language

**Example:**
✅ "The order says exchanges at 6pm. I'll be there at 6pm. If you're late, please text me."
❌ "Well I guess I'll wait around at 6pm even though you're always late. Whatever."

### Communication Methods

**Written Only (Text/Email) During High Conflict:**
- Creates record
- Time to compose thoughtfully
- Prevents escalation
- Can be shown to court/attorney

**DO NOT:**
- Rely on verbal discussions (no record, becomes "he said/she said")
- Have heated phone calls
- Argue via text (stay BINF even if provoked)

**Co-Parenting Apps (Excellent for High Conflict):**
- **OurFamilyWizard**
- **TalkingParents**
- **AppClose**

**Features:**
- All communication logged (can't be deleted)
- Tone monitoring (flags hostile language)
- Shared calendar
- Expense tracking
- Can be court-ordered
- Reduces "bad" communication

**Court likes these apps** - shows you're trying to communicate appropriately.

### Phone/Video Calls with Children

**If ordered or agreed:**
- Other parent provides reasonable access for child to talk to you during their parenting time
- Typically: Daily call (5-15 minutes)
- Bedtime calls common for young children
- Video calls (FaceTime, Zoom) preferred

**Parent's obligations:**
- Make child available at agreed time
- Privacy for call (don't eavesdrop)
- Facilitate connection (help child with tech if needed)
- Don't badmouth other parent before/after call

**Calling parent:**
- Stick to agreed time (don't call excessively)
- Age-appropriate conversation
- Don't interrogate child about other parent
- Keep it positive

**If other parent interfering with calls:**
- Document (dates/times of attempted calls, refusals)
- Send written requests for makeup calls
- File motion to enforce/modify if pattern of denial

---

## Temporary Orders Red Flags

### Partner Violating Temporary Orders

**Common violations:**

**1. Denying Parenting Time**
- Not making child available at exchange
- Last-minute cancellations without valid reason
- Making child "unavailable" during your time

**What to do:**
- **Document:** Date, time, what happened
- **Communicate in writing:** "Per the court order, I was to pick up Emma at 6pm today. I arrived at 6pm and you would not answer the door. Please confirm what time I can pick her up."
- **Continue showing up:** Even if they deny time, keep coming (shows you're trying)
- **Don't retaliate:** Don't withhold your time in response
- **File enforcement:** If pattern of violations, file contempt motion

**2. Not Paying Support**
- Missing payments
- Paying late
- Paying less than ordered

**What to do:**
- **Document:** Every missed or late payment
- **Keep trying to collect:** Send written requests
- **Don't deny parenting time:** Support and parenting time are SEPARATE
- **File enforcement:** Contempt motion, wage garnishment, support enforcement through state agency

**3. Making Unilateral Major Decisions**
- Enrolling child in new school without consulting you (if joint legal custody)
- Medical decisions beyond emergency
- Changing child's religious upbringing

**What to do:**
- **Object in writing immediately:** "The court order provides for joint legal custody. You enrolled Joey in new school without consulting me. I do not consent. Please arrange conference with current school and me before any changes."
- **File motion:** Request court find violation, reinstate prior arrangement, sanction other party

**4. Violating Financial Orders**
- Draining joint accounts
- Selling assets without permission
- Not paying assigned bills
- Canceling insurance

**What to do:**
- **Document:** Screenshots, statements showing violation
- **Notify attorney immediately**
- **File enforcement motion:** Seek reimbursement, sanctions, attorney fees

### You're Unclear About Requirements

**Problem:** Order is ambiguous or you're not sure what it means.

**DON'T:**
- Guess and risk violating
- Ignore it
- Just do what you think is reasonable

**DO:**
- **Ask other party's interpretation in writing:** "The order says I have parenting time 'alternate weekends.' I interpret that as first and third weekend of month. Do you agree?"
- **Ask attorney for interpretation**
- **File motion for clarification:** Court can issue clarifying order

### Orders Are Impossible to Follow

**Problem:** Court ordered something that doesn't work in practice.

**Examples:**
- Exchange time conflicts with your work schedule you disclosed at hearing
- Support amount exceeds your net income
- Schedule doesn't work with child's activities
- Geographic distance makes schedule unworkable

**DON'T:**
- Just stop complying
- Hope it will be okay
- Assume court will understand

**DO:**
- **File motion to modify immediately:** Don't wait for contempt hearing to explain
- **Show good faith:** Comply as best you can while motion pending
- **Propose alternative:** Have solution ready
- **Document why impossible:** Work schedule, school schedule, child's needs

## When to Move to Next Stage

You're ready for **Stage 6: Financial Disclosures & Discovery** when:

✅ Compliance systems in place (payment methods, calendar)
✅ Immediate custody/support/property issues resolved (at least temporarily)
✅ Case ready for next phase: comprehensive financial disclosures
