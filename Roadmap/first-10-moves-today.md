**Impact:** Critical—these moves prevent common early mistakes and position you for better outcome

---

## Move 1: Assess Your Safety (safety-crisis agent)

**Time: 15-30 minutes**

### If you're in immediate danger:

**Do this NOW:**
- [ ] Leave. Go to friend's house, hotel, or domestic violence shelter. Safety first.
- [ ] Call 911 if actively threatened or assaulted
- [ ] National Domestic Violence Hotline: **1-800-799-7233** (24/7, confidential)
- [ ] Take children with you if safe to do so
- [ ] Don't tell spouse where you're going if you fear violence

**If violence occurred recently:**
- [ ] Photograph injuries (close-ups showing bruises, cuts, marks)
- [ ] Seek medical attention (creates medical record, documents injuries)
- [ ] File police report (even if you don't want spouse arrested—creates evidence)

### If you're not in immediate danger but have concerns:

**Safety assessment (answer honestly):**
- Has spouse ever physically harmed you or children?
- Has spouse threatened to harm you, children, or themselves?
- Do you fear spouse's reaction when they learn about divorce?
- Has spouse controlled your access to money, transportation, communication?
- Has spouse monitored your location, phone, or computer?

**If you answered YES to any:**
- [ ] Create safety plan (see [Strategies to Protect Yourself & Kids](strategies-protect-yourself-and-kids.md))
- [ ] Identify safe person/place to go if needed
- [ ] Keep "go bag" ready (cash, ID, keys, phone charger, medications, change of clothes)
- [ ] Set up code word with trusted friend ("If I text 'banana', call 911")

**If all NO:**
- [ ] Still set up basic safety measures (financial access, document copies—see below)

---

## Move 2: Secure Critical Documents (document-evidence agent)

**Time: 1-2 hours**

### What you CAN legally do RIGHT NOW:

You have the right to access and copy marital documents. Do this **before spouse knows you're divorcing** (they may hide/destroy documents once they know).

### Documents to copy/photograph immediately:

**Financial (highest priority):**
- [ ] Last 3 years tax returns (both federal and state)
- [ ] Recent pay stubs (yours and spouse's—last 3 months if possible)
- [ ] Bank statements (all accounts—checking, savings, joint, individual—last 12 months)
- [ ] Credit card statements (all cards—last 12 months)
- [ ] Investment/brokerage account statements (last 12 months)
- [ ] Retirement account statements (401k, IRA, pension—most recent)
- [ ] Mortgage statements, property deeds
- [ ] Vehicle titles, loan statements
- [ ] Business records (if spouse owns business—tax returns, profit/loss statements, balance sheets)
- [ ] Credit reports (for both of you—pull from annualcreditreport.com)

**Personal/Legal:**
- [ ] Marriage certificate
- [ ] Birth certificates (yours, spouse's, children's)
- [ ] Social Security cards
- [ ] Passports
- [ ] Immigration documents (if applicable)
- [ ] Prenuptial or postnuptial agreement (if any)

**Children (if applicable):**
- [ ] School records, report cards
- [ ] Medical records, immunization records
- [ ] Extracurricular records (sports teams, clubs)
- [ ] Childcare records, costs

**How to copy:**
- Scan documents to USB drive or cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox—create account in your name only)
- OR photograph with phone, back up to cloud
- OR make physical copies, store in safe location (friend's house, office, safety deposit box)

**IMPORTANT:** You can legally access joint accounts and marital home documents even if they're "in spouse's name." Community property = both spouses have right to access.

**What you CANNOT do:**
- Access spouse's individual email or computer without permission (illegal hacking)
- Open spouse's mail (federal crime)
- Break into spouse's locked safe or office (trespassing/theft)

---

## Move 3: Protect Your Finances (financial-forensics agent)

**Time: 30-60 minutes**

### Immediate actions:

**Open individual accounts (in your name only):**
- [ ] Individual checking account at **different bank** than joint accounts (prevents spouse from talking bank into giving them access)
- [ ] Individual savings account
- [ ] Individual credit card (if you don't have one in your name only)

**Why:** Once spouse knows about divorce, they may empty joint accounts, max out joint credit cards, or cut off your access. You need funds you control.

**Transfer your share of community funds:**
- [ ] Calculate total in joint accounts
- [ ] Transfer 50% to your individual account (your community property share)
- [ ] Document the transfer (screenshot, bank statement showing 50/50 split)

**Example:**
- Joint checking: $10,000
- Transfer $5,000 to your individual checking
- Leave $5,000 in joint account

**IMPORTANT:** Take only your 50% share. Taking more = dissipation, breach of fiduciary duty (you'll owe it back + penalties).

**Freeze joint credit cards:**
- [ ] Call each credit card company
- [ ] Request they freeze account (no new charges until both spouses agree)
- [ ] Explain: "I'm separating from my spouse. Please freeze this account to prevent new charges."

**Why:** Prevents spouse from running up debt you're liable for.

**Monitor accounts daily:**
- [ ] Set up alerts for all joint accounts (email/text alert for transactions >$500)
- [ ] Check balances daily for next few weeks

**Check credit report:**
- [ ] Go to annualcreditreport.com (free, official site)
- [ ] Pull your credit report from all 3 bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion)
- [ ] Review for unknown accounts, debts, or suspicious activity

**If you find accounts you didn't know about:**
- Document (screenshot, print report)
- Include in asset list for disclosure later
- May indicate spouse hiding assets

**Do NOT:**
- Empty joint accounts (take 100%)—that's dissipation
- Max out joint credit cards—you'll owe half that debt
- Sell community property (house, car, investments) without spouse's consent or court order
- Cash out retirement accounts (triggers taxes + early withdrawal penalty + ATRO violation)

---

## Move 4: Document Your Parenting (coparenting agent)

**Time: 30-45 minutes**

**If you have children, start documenting your involvement NOW.** Custody battles are won by evidence, not emotion.

### Create parenting log:

**Use:** Notebook, Google Doc, co-parenting app, or notes app (anything with date/time stamps)

**Document daily (next 2-4 weeks minimum):**
- [ ] What parenting tasks you did (prepared meals, helped with homework, drove to school/activities, put to bed, attended school event)
- [ ] Time spent with children (hours per day, overnight stays)
- [ ] Medical/school appointments you attended
- [ ] Any concerning incidents (spouse yelling at kids, leaving kids unsupervised, substance use around kids, missed parenting time)

**Example entry:**
```
Date: 2025-10-31
- Woke kids at 7am, made breakfast (pancakes)
- Dropped Emma at school 8:15am, dropped Jake at daycare 8:30am
- Picked up Jake at 5pm, Emma at 5:30pm
- Helped Emma with math homework 6-6:30pm
- Made dinner (chicken, broccoli, rice) 6:30pm
- Bath time 7:30pm, read bedtime stories 8pm
- Kids asleep by 8:30pm

Spouse arrived home at 9pm (works late M-F). Did not see kids today.
```

**Why this matters:**
- Proves your involvement (if spouse claims you're "never around," you have evidence you are)
- Establishes status quo (courts favor maintaining children's routine)
- Documents any issues with spouse's parenting (if applicable)

### Photograph status quo:

- [ ] Children's bedrooms (at your home, showing their belongings, familiar environment)
- [ ] Family photos (you with children, showing bond)
- [ ] School/activity schedules (proves involvement)

### Identify witnesses:

- [ ] Teachers (who attends conferences, volunteers in classroom)
- [ ] Coaches (who comes to games/practices)
- [ ] Daycare providers (who does pickup/dropoff)
- [ ] Neighbors (who spends time with kids)
- [ ] Family members (who can attest to your parenting)

**You don't need to contact them yet**—just identify who could testify to your parenting if needed.

### Do NOT:

- Tell children about potential divorce (wait until you've consulted attorney, have plan)
- Badmouth spouse to children ("Your dad is leaving us," "Your mom doesn't care about you")
- Interrogate children ("Does Dad have a girlfriend?" "What does Mom say about me?")
- Coach children ("If judge asks, say you want to live with me")
- Use children as messengers ("Tell your dad we need to talk")

**Exception:** If children ask directly ("Are you and Dad getting divorced?"), age-appropriate honest answer is okay: "Dad and I are having some grown-up problems. We're working on it. This is not your fault. We both love you very much."

---

## Move 5: Start Your Evidence File (document-evidence agent)

**Time: 30-60 minutes**

### Create organized evidence system:

**Option 1: Digital (recommended)**
- Create Google Drive folder: "Divorce Evidence" (in your name only, don't share with spouse)
- Subfolders:
  - Financial (bank statements, pay stubs, tax returns, asset documents)
  - Parenting (parenting log, school records, photos of kids)
  - Communications (screenshots of texts/emails with spouse)
  - Incidents (photos of damage, injury, concerning behavior)
  - Legal (any court docs once filed)

**Option 2: Physical**
- Get 3-ring binder or expanding file folder
- Section dividers for categories above
- Store in safe location (not marital home if spouse might destroy)

### Immediate evidence to preserve:

**Communications:**
- [ ] Do NOT delete any texts, emails, voicemails from spouse (even if angry, mean, embarrassing to you)
- [ ] Screenshot important texts (threats, admissions, agreements about kids/finances)
- [ ] Save emails to separate folder
- [ ] Change your passwords (email, phone, computer, bank accounts)—assume spouse may try to access

**Financial:**
- [ ] Documents from Move 2 (tax returns, bank statements, etc.)
- [ ] Screenshot of joint account balances AS OF TODAY (before you transfer your 50%)
- [ ] List of all assets (house, cars, retirement accounts, investments, valuables)—include dates acquired, approximate values

**Parenting:**
- [ ] Parenting log from Move 4
- [ ] Photos of children in your care
- [ ] Calendar showing your parenting time (if you already have informal custody schedule)

**Incidents (if applicable):**
- [ ] Photos of injuries (if spouse harmed you)
- [ ] Photos of damage (if spouse destroyed property)
- [ ] Police reports
- [ ] Medical records documenting domestic violence

### Start written log of key events:

**Today, write down:**
- Date you decided to pursue divorce
- Date of marriage
- Date of separation (if already separated; if not, date spouse moves out or you file)
- Brief marriage history (major events: bought house, kids born, significant job changes, separations)

**Going forward, document:**
- Concerning incidents (arguments, threats, violence, substance abuse, poor parenting)
- Financial red flags (large withdrawals, new purchases, money missing)
- Parenting denials (if spouse refuses to let you see kids, cancels your time)

---

## Move 6: Protect Your Digital Privacy (document-evidence agent + safety-crisis agent)

**Time: 30-45 minutes**

### Assume spouse may try to access your accounts or monitor you:

**Change all passwords immediately:**
- [ ] Email (all accounts)
- [ ] Phone passcode
- [ ] Computer login
- [ ] Bank accounts, credit cards
- [ ] Social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
- [ ] Cloud storage (Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox)
- [ ] Amazon, online shopping accounts

**Use strong, unique passwords:** Not spouse's birthday, anniversary, children's names. Use password manager (LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden).

**Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):**
- [ ] Email
- [ ] Bank accounts
- [ ] Any account with 2FA option

**Check for spyware (if you suspect monitoring):**
- [ ] Factory reset phone (AFTER backing up photos, contacts to cloud)
- [ ] Run antivirus/antimalware on computer (Malwarebytes, Norton, McAfee)
- [ ] Check phone for unfamiliar apps (especially "Find My Phone" or parental control apps you didn't install)

**Signs of spyware:**
- Spouse knows things they shouldn't (where you went, who you called, what you searched online)
- Phone battery drains fast, overheats
- Data usage higher than normal
- Phone lights up when not in use

**If you find spyware:**
- Factory reset phone
- Change all passwords from clean device (friend's computer, library computer)
- Consider new phone number
- Document (screenshot the spyware app, note when you discovered it)—this is illegal (federal wiretapping), potential evidence

**Social media:**
- [ ] Change privacy settings to "Friends Only" (not public)
- [ ] Review friend list (remove spouse's family/friends if concerned they're reporting to spouse)
- [ ] Do NOT post about divorce, legal case, spouse, or your feelings ("My ex is a narcissist," "Can't believe what judge ruled")
- [ ] Do NOT post photos of partying, drinking, new romantic relationship (can be used against you in custody fight)

**Communicate securely:**
- [ ] Create new email address spouse doesn't know (for attorney communication, job search, private matters)
- [ ] Use only your email for important matters (don't use shared family email)

---

## Move 7: Consult an Attorney (legal-navigator agent)

**Time: 1-2 hours for consultations**

### Why NOW (before you tell spouse, before you file):

- Attorney advises you on first moves (did you do anything wrong in Moves 1-6? What to do next?)
- Explains your rights (property division, custody, support in your state)
- Prevents costly mistakes (you don't know what you don't know)
- Develops strategy (should you file first? What to request?)

### Finding attorney:

**Option 1: Referrals**
- Ask trusted friends/family who divorced (who was their attorney? Would they recommend?)
- Ask therapist, financial advisor, clergy for recommendations

**Option 2: State bar association**
- Google "[Your state] bar association lawyer referral"
- Many states have referral services (they match you with attorneys by practice area)

**Option 3: Online directories**
- Avvo.com, Lawyers.com, Martindale.com
- Filter by: Family law, your city, client reviews

### Initial consultations:

- [ ] Schedule consultations with **3-5 attorneys** (most offer free or low-cost initial consultation—30-60 min)
- [ ] Prepare for consultation (bring financial summary, brief marriage history, list of questions)

**Questions to ask:**
1. How long have you practiced family law in this state?
2. What's your approach to my case? (litigation vs. settlement)
3. What's a realistic outcome for custody/property/support in my situation?
4. What are your fees? (hourly rate, retainer amount, payment plans)
5. What should I do in the next 2-4 weeks?
6. How will we communicate? (email, phone, how often)
7. Who else will work on my case? (associate attorneys, paralegals)

**Choosing attorney:**
- Experience (5+ years family law in your state)
- Communication style (do they listen? Explain clearly? Respond to emails/calls promptly?)
- Cost (can you afford them? Do they offer payment plans?)
- Strategy fit (if you want to settle, don't hire "bulldog litigator"; if you need aggressive representation, don't hire "collaborative only" attorney)

**Can't afford attorney?**
- Legal Aid (free for low-income; Google "[your state] legal aid")
- Law school clinics (free/low-cost, supervised by professors)
- Limited scope representation (attorney helps with specific tasks, you handle rest—cheaper than full representation)
- Pro se (represent yourself—use this roadmap + your state's court self-help resources)

---

## Move 8: Create Post-Divorce Budget (wellbeing-logistics agent + financial-forensics agent)

**Time: 1 hour**

### Reality check: What will life cost after divorce?

**Why do this NOW:**
- Informs your settlement position (how much support do you need? Can you afford to keep house?)
- Prevents agreeing to unaffordable arrangements
- Identifies financial gaps (do you need to increase income, reduce expenses, get support?)

### Calculate your post-divorce monthly expenses:

**Housing:**
- [ ] Rent or mortgage (if you're keeping house, full mortgage; if you're moving, estimated rent)
- [ ] Property taxes, insurance (if homeowner)
- [ ] Utilities (electric, gas, water, trash, internet, phone)
- [ ] Maintenance, repairs (budget 1-2% of home value per year)

**Children (if you'll have majority of parenting time):**
- [ ] Childcare (daycare, after-school care, babysitters)
- [ ] School costs (tuition if private, fees, supplies, lunches)
- [ ] Extracurriculars (sports, music lessons, clubs—monthly average)
- [ ] Clothing (budget $50-100/month per child)
- [ ] Medical (insurance premiums, copays, prescriptions)

**Personal:**
- [ ] Food, groceries ($300-600/month for 1 adult, add $150-250/child)
- [ ] Transportation (car payment, insurance, gas, maintenance)
- [ ] Health insurance (if you'll lose coverage through spouse's employer)
- [ ] Other insurance (life, disability if needed)
- [ ] Debts (credit cards, loans, student loans)
- [ ] Personal care (haircuts, clothing, toiletries—budget $100-200/month)
- [ ] Entertainment, dining out (budget $100-300/month)
- [ ] Savings (emergency fund, retirement—at least 10% of income)

**Total monthly expenses: $___________**

### Calculate your post-divorce income:

**Your earnings:**
- [ ] Current monthly take-home pay (after taxes): $___________
- [ ] Potential child support (use your state's calculator—Google "[your state] child support calculator"): $___________
- [ ] Potential spousal support (estimate based on your state's guidelines or attorney advice): $___________

**Total monthly income: $___________**

### Gap analysis:

**Income - Expenses = $___________**

**If negative (expenses exceed income):**
- You need to: Increase income (get job, increase hours, seek higher support), reduce expenses (downsize housing, cut discretionary spending), or both
- This is your support need (justify spousal support request based on this gap)

**If positive (income exceeds expenses):**
- You have cushion (good)
- If paying support, budget for that

## Move 9: Take Care of Your Wellbeing (wellbeing-logistics agent)

**Time: 30-60 minutes**

### Divorce is one of life's most stressful events. You must prioritize self-care to survive it.

**Mental health:**
- [ ] **Schedule therapy appointment THIS WEEK** (if you don't have therapist, get one NOW)
  - Google: "[Your city] therapist divorce" or use Psychology Today therapist finder
  - Many therapists offer sliding scale (reduced fees based on income)
  - Ask about telehealth (video sessions—more flexible scheduling)
- [ ] If you're having thoughts of self-harm or suicide, call **988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)** right now—24/7, free, confidential

**Why therapy is essential:**
- Process emotions (grief, anger, fear) in healthy way
- Decision-making support (therapist provides objective perspective)
- Prevent depression, anxiety from worsening
- Testimony (if needed—therapist can attest to your mental health, efforts to cope healthily)

**Tell trusted people:**
- [ ] Identify 2-3 trusted friends/family members
- [ ] Tell them you're divorcing (you need support system—don't try to "handle this alone")
- [ ] Ask for specific help: "Can you watch kids on Tuesday so I can meet with attorney?" "Can I call you when I'm feeling overwhelmed?"

**Self-care basics:**
- [ ] Sleep: Aim for 7-8 hours/night (even if you can't sleep well, create routine—no screens 1 hour before bed, dark room, consistent bedtime)
- [ ] Eat: Regular meals even if you're not hungry (grief suppresses appetite—force yourself to eat something 3x/day)
- [ ] Move: Walk 20-30 minutes daily (exercise reduces stress, improves mood)
- [ ] Avoid: Alcohol, drugs (tempting to numb pain—don't; substance use worsens mental health + can cost you custody)

**Work:**
- [ ] Inform your supervisor (brief, professional: "I'm going through a divorce. I may need flexibility for attorney meetings and court dates. I'm committed to my work.")
- [ ] Request FMLA if needed (if you have mental health crisis, domestic violence, need time off for legal matters—up to 12 weeks unpaid leave, job-protected)

**Children's wellbeing:**
- [ ] Monitor children for signs of distress (behavior changes, academic decline, withdrawal, aggression)
- [ ] Maintain routine (bedtime, meals, school, activities—consistency = security for kids)
- [ ] Consider therapy for children (especially if high-conflict divorce, children witnessed abuse, children struggling emotionally)

---

## Move 10: Plan Your Next 30 Days (All agents)

**Time: 15-30 minutes**

### You've completed the critical first moves. Now create a 30-day roadmap:

- What's my priority for next week?
- How am I feeling? (mental health check)
- Do I need help? (from attorney, therapist, friend, family)
