## Support Obligations

### REQUIRED:

**Child Support:**
✓ Must pay guideline child support (unless court approves deviation)
✓ Must pay on time, every month (from date ordered)
✓ Cannot skip or reduce payments without court order (even if you lost job—must file modification)

**Spousal Support:**
✓ Must pay as ordered (amount, timing)
✓ Cannot reduce or stop without court order
✓ Continues until termination event (remarriage, death, date specified)

**Add-Ons:**
✓ Pay share of childcare, uninsured medical expenses, extracurriculars (per order—typically proportional to income)

### NOT ALLOWED:

✗ **Self-help reductions:** "She got a job, so I'm paying $500 less"—NO. You must file motion to modify.
✗ **Withholding for non-compliance:** "She won't let me see kids, so I'm not paying support"—NO. Support and parenting time are separate. Don't self-help.
✗ **Paying late:** Support is due on specific date. Late = arrears + interest.
✗ **Paying in cash without receipt:** Document all payments (check, money order, online transfer with confirmation). Cash with no receipt = you can't prove you paid.
✗ **Hiding income to reduce support:** Court will impute income, impose sanctions.

**Enforcement If Ex Doesn't Pay:**
✓ File contempt motion
✓ Contact child support enforcement agency (free)
✓ Wage garnishment, license suspension, tax refund intercept

**Modification:**
✓ CAN file motion to modify if material change (income change, custody change)
✓ Effective from date you FILE motion (not retroactive)

✓ **BINF communication:** Brief, Informative, Neutral, Firm
✓ **Child-focused:** "Soccer practice changed to Tuesday 5pm"

✓ **Information sharing:** School reports, medical info, schedule changes

## Property & Belongings

### ALLOWED (During Separation, Before Judgment):

✓ Take your separate property (owned before marriage, gifts/inheritance to you)

✗ **Sell community property without permission:** (Car, collectibles, jewelry—unless de minimis value)

**Remedy:**
- If ex empties house: Request court order returning property or paying you for your share
- If ex dissipates: Request accounting, charge ex for dissipated amounts

---

## Post-Separation Relationships & Dating

### ALLOWED:

✓ Date (you're separated, this is legal)
✓ Introduce children to new partner (after relationship is stable—typically 6+ months, per family therapists)
✓ New partner can be around children during your parenting time (unless order prohibits)
✓ Have new partner stay overnight when children present (unless order restricts)

**Caveat:** Even if legal, consider children's emotional wellbeing. Too-quick introductions, revolving door of partners, or new partner playing "parent" can harm children.

### NOT ALLOWED (In Some Cases):

✗ **Overnight guests with children present:** Some orders prohibit opposite-sex overnight guests during parenting time (usually if high conflict or conservative jurisdiction)
✗ **Involving new partner in parenting decisions:** New partner can't discipline, make decisions (that's you and ex)
✗ **Exposing children to inappropriate behavior:** New partner and you engaging in PDA, adult conversations, drug/alcohol use around children

**Impact on Custody:**
- If you introduce many different partners quickly, or new partner behaves inappropriately around children, ex can file motion to modify custody arguing instability
- If new partner has criminal history (violence, sex offenses), child abuse, substance abuse, court may restrict their contact with children

**Best Practice:**
- Wait 6+ months before introducing children to new partner
- Introduce gradually (first meeting brief, in public place)
- No sleepovers until relationship very stable (1 year+)
- New partner respects you as parent (doesn't discipline, doesn't override your decisions)

## Social Media & Public Communication

### ALLOWED:

✓ Use social media (you don't have to quit Facebook, Instagram)
✓ Post about your life (travel, hobbies, friends)
✓ Share your side of story with trusted friends

### NOT ALLOWED (Inadvisable):

✗ **Post about divorce, ex, court case:** "My ex is a narcissist," "Family court is corrupt," "Judge ruled against me"
✗ **Badmouth ex publicly:** Even if you don't tag them, mutual friends will see; could constitute harassment
✗ **Post about new relationship too early:** Can be used against you in custody fight ("Cares more about new girlfriend than kids")
✗ **Post about partying, drinking, drugs:** Can be used to argue you're unfit parent
✗ **Post children without ex's consent:** Some orders require mutual agreement before posting children's photos (privacy/safety)
✗ **Flaunt wealth:** If claiming you can't afford support, don't post photos of European vacation

**Why This Matters:**
- Anything you post can be screenshotted and used as evidence
- Judges Google parties—public social media may be viewed
- Discovery can request social media posts
- Posts showing irresponsibility, poor judgment, conflict, or parenting concerns = evidence against you

**Best Practice:**
- Private accounts (friends only)
- Review privacy settings
- Don't post about divorce/ex
- Think before you post: "Would I want judge to see this?"

## Summary: Know Your Boundaries

**ALLOWED:**
- Access joint accounts and marital home documents
- Pay ordinary expenses, attorney fees
- Make day-to-day parenting decisions during your time
- Date, have new relationships (introduce appropriately to children)
- Exercise your parenting time per order
- File motions to modify if circumstances change

**NOT ALLOWED:**
- Hack ex's accounts, install spyware, illegal recording
- Violate ATROs (sell/hide/dissipate community property)
- Violate custody orders (withhold time, deny access)
- Stop paying support (must file modification first)
- Alienate children (badmouth ex, block contact, interrogate)

**Golden Rule:** When in doubt, ask your attorney. Violating court orders, committing crimes, or engaging in misconduct harms your case far more than it helps.
