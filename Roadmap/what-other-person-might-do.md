## Financial Manipulation (financial-forensics agent)

### Asset Hiding & Dissipation

**Common Tactics:**
- **Cash withdrawals:** Large ATM withdrawals or checks to "cash"
- **Transfers to family/friends:** "Loans" to relatives, moving money to parent's account
- **Purchasing assets in others' names:** Buying property/vehicles in girlfriend's, business partner's, or relative's name
- **Overpaying debts/taxes:** Paying extra on debts to deplete cash, then requesting "refund" post-divorce
- **Delaying bonuses/income:** Asking employer to defer bonus until after divorce final
- **Cryptocurrency:** Purchasing crypto and not disclosing (hard to trace)
- **Business manipulation:** If self-employed—inflating expenses, deferring receipts, paying salary to non-existent employees
- **Gambling "losses":** Claiming lost money gambling (actually gave to friend for safekeeping)
- **Destroying assets:** Deliberately damaging/destroying property to reduce value
- **Hidden bank accounts:** Opening accounts you don't know about (check credit report for unfamiliar banks)

**How to Detect:**
- Monitor joint account activity daily (set up alerts for transactions >$500)
- Compare tax returns year-over-year (income suddenly dropped?)
- Lifestyle vs. disclosed income (living like earning $150K but claiming $60K)
- Compare stated expenses to actual spending (credit card statements show $5K/month spending, claiming $2K)

**Your Response:**
- Document all suspicious transactions (screenshots, statements)
- Request accounting via discovery (interrogatories: "Where did $30K from joint account go?")
- Hire forensic accountant (traces money, identifies hidden assets)
- File emergency motion (freeze accounts, prohibit transfers)
- Request sanctions (court orders reimbursement + attorney fees)

### Income Manipulation

**Tactics:**
- **Voluntary underemployment:** Quitting high-paying job for lower-paying job to reduce support
- **Deferring income:** Asking employer to delay bonus, commission until after divorce
- **Cash side jobs:** Working under the table, not reporting income
- **Business owners:** Reducing salary, taking distributions as "loans," hiding revenue

**How to Detect:**
- Compare income to previous years (sudden 40% drop without explanation?)
- Lifestyle analysis (expenses exceed stated income)
- Subpoena employer (verify actual income, bonus schedule)
- Review business financials (profit margins lower than industry standard?)

**Your Response:**
- Request imputation of income (court attributes higher income based on earning capacity)
- Hire vocational evaluator (assesses earning capacity)
- Forensic accountant analyzes business income

## Safety & Control Tactics (safety-crisis agent)

### Financial Control

**Tactics:**
- **Cutting off access:** Removing you from bank accounts, credit cards, blocking access to funds
- **Running up debt:** Maxing out joint credit cards you're liable for
- **Refusing to pay bills:** Not paying mortgage, utilities to pressure you or damage credit
- **Hiding assets:** So you can't accurately calculate support or division
- **Threats:** "If you file for divorce, you'll get nothing"

**Your Response:**
- Open individual accounts immediately (transfer half of joint funds—your community property share)
- Freeze joint credit cards (prevent new charges)
- Document threats (save texts, emails, record conversations if legal in your state)
- Emergency motion (request orders protecting financial access)

### Surveillance & Stalking

**Tactics:**

- **Physical following:** Following you to work, store, new partner's house
- **Enlisting others:** Having friends/family follow or spy on you
- **Camera installation:** Placing cameras to monitor you (your home, workplace)

**How to Detect:**
- Phone battery drains fast, overheats (sign of spyware)
- Ex knows things they shouldn't (where you went, who you talked to)
- See same car repeatedly (following you)
- Find unfamiliar device in car (GPS tracker)

**Your Response:**
- Factory reset phone (after backing up data)

- Document stalking (dates, times, locations, photos)
- Protective order (if stalking/harassment)
- Call police (stalking is crime)

### Emotional & Psychological Abuse

**Tactics:**
- **Gaslighting:** "That never happened," "You're crazy," making you doubt your reality
- **Threats:** "I'll take the kids away," "You'll never see them again," "I'll ruin you financially"
- **Intimidation:** Angry outbursts, destroying property, aggressive behavior
- **Isolation:** Turning friends/family against you
- **Using children:** Threatening to harm or take children if you don't comply

**Your Response:**
- Document (written log of incidents, save threatening messages)

## Parenting Interference (coparenting agent)

### Alienation Tactics

**What Ex Might Do:**
- **Badmouthing you:** Telling children you're bad parent, you abandoned them, you don't love them
- **Blocking contact:** Not answering when you call children, "forgetting" to relay messages
- **Scheduling conflicts:** Enrolling children in activities during your parenting time without consulting you
- **Erasing you:** Removing photos of you, not mentioning you, acting like you don't exist
- **False allegations:** Accusing you of abuse to justify limiting your contact
- **Forcing choice:** "Do you want to live with me or Mom?" (putting child in impossible position)
- **Rewarding rejection:** Buying gifts, special treats when child refuses to see you

**Impact:**
- Child becomes anxious, confused, guilty
- Child resists visiting you
- Damaged parent-child relationship
- Long-term psychological harm to child

**Your Response:**
- Document specific instances (dates, what ex said/did, how child reacted)
- Continue consistent involvement (attend school events, call regularly, exercise parenting time)
- Reassure child ("I love you, it's not your job to choose, you can love both of us")
- Don't retaliate (don't badmouth ex—be the stable, healthy parent)
- Seek court intervention (motion to modify custody, request family therapy, parenting coordinator)
- Reunification therapy (court-ordered therapy to repair relationship)

### Gatekeeping

**Tactics:**
- **Blocking information:** Not telling you about school conferences, medical appointments, extracurriculars
- **Excluding you:** Not inviting you to school events, birthday parties
- **Making unilateral decisions:** Enrolling child in new school, changing doctor without consulting you (violates joint legal custody)
- **Denying parenting time:** "Child is sick" (when not), "We have plans," making excuses to cancel your time
- **Last-minute changes:** Changing pickup time/location without notice, making it difficult for you to comply

**Your Response:**
- Assert your rights ("Per our custody order, I have joint legal custody. I must be consulted on educational decisions.")
- Contact school/doctor directly (request to be added to contact list, get copies of reports)
- Document denials (dates ex denied parenting time, reasons given)
- File contempt motion (if pattern of violations)
- Request makeup time (for parenting time ex wrongfully denied)

### Using Children as Pawns

**Tactics:**
- **Withholding parenting time:** "If you don't pay extra, you can't see kids"
- **Interrogating children:** Pumping children for information about your life
- **Using children as messengers:** "Tell your dad he owes child support," "Tell your mom she's a bad mother"
- **Forcing children to take sides:** "I'm the good parent, your other parent is bad"

**Your Response:**
- Don't use children as leverage yourself (don't withhold time to retaliate)
- Shield children (don't interrogate them about ex, don't send messages through them)
- Court enforcement (contempt if ex denying parenting time)
- Therapy for children (to process being put in middle)

## Court & Legal Manipulation (court-compliance agent)

### Litigation Abuse

**Tactics:**
- **Frivolous motions:** Filing repetitive, baseless motions to drain your money (attorney fees) and energy
- **Vexatious litigation:** Using court as weapon, not to resolve issues but to harass
- **Discovery abuse:** Propounding excessive, irrelevant discovery requests (forcing you to spend time and money responding)
- **Last-minute tactics:** Filing motions right before hearings, changing positions constantly (prevents preparation)
- **False allegations:** Accusing you of abuse, drug use, unfitness to gain advantage
- **Refusing to settle:** Rejecting reasonable offers, dragging out case unnecessarily

**Your Response:**
- Request sanctions (court can order ex to pay your attorney fees for frivolous conduct)
- Vexatious litigant designation (if extreme—court restricts ex's ability to file motions without pre-approval)
- Document pattern (show court ex is abusing process)
- Settlement pressure (your attorney communicates: "Your client's conduct is costing them attorney fees and credibility")

### Order Violations

**What Ex Might Violate:**
- **Temporary orders:** Not paying temporary support, violating ATRO (selling/hiding assets)
- **Custody orders:** Denying parenting time, keeping children past scheduled time
- **Financial orders:** Not producing financial disclosures, not refinancing mortgage as ordered
- **Communication orders:** Violating "no contact" provisions (if protective order)

**Your Response:**
- Document violations (dates, what was violated, evidence)
- Send written demand ("Per our court order, you are required to [X]. Please comply within 48 hours.")
- File contempt motion (if no compliance)
- Request sanctions (attorney fees, makeup time, fines, jail time for willful violations)

### Delay Tactics

**Tactics:**
- **Failing to respond:** Not filing response to motions, ignoring deadlines
- **Requesting continuances:** Repeatedly asking to postpone hearings
- **Dragging out discovery:** Slow-walking document production, objecting to everything
- **Refusing to settle:** Making negotiations drag on indefinitely
- **Changing attorneys:** Firing attorneys repeatedly (each new attorney needs time to get up to speed)

**Purpose:**
- Hope you'll give up or run out of money
- Maintain status quo (if status quo favors ex)
- Frustrate you into accepting bad deal

**Your Response:**
- Set deadlines ("We need your financial disclosures by [date] or we'll file motion to compel")
- File motions to compel (force compliance with discovery, deadlines)
- Request sanctions (for delays)
- Trial-ready attitude ("We're prepared to go to trial if you won't negotiate reasonably")

## Preparing for These Tactics

### Proactive Measures

**1. Document Everything:**
- Financial records, communications, parenting time, violations
- Written log, photos, screenshots, recordings (if legal)
- Preserve evidence (don't delete)

**2. Know Your Rights:**
- Custody orders: When, where, how long you have children
- Financial access: Joint accounts, community property rights
- Legal custody: Your right to information and involvement in major decisions

**3. Set Boundaries:**
- Communication: "All non-emergency communication via email only"
- Financial: "I will not give you money outside of court-ordered support"
- Parenting: "I will exercise my parenting time per our schedule"

**4. Support System:**
- Attorney (guides legal strategy, files motions)
- Therapist (helps process manipulation, maintain stability)
- Trusted friends/family (emotional support, witnesses)
- Support groups (connect with others experiencing similar tactics)

**5. Stay Calm:**
- Don't react emotionally (ex may be trying to provoke you—don't give them ammunition)
- Respond strategically (through attorney, in writing, based on evidence)
- Take care of yourself (sleep, exercise, eat, therapy)

### Responding to Manipulation

**Don't:**
- Retaliate (don't hide assets, deny parenting time, or violate orders in response)
- Engage in conflict (don't argue via text, don't respond to bait)
- Ignore violations (thinking it will stop—it usually escalates)

**Do:**
- Document (evidence is your weapon)
- Enforce orders (file contempt when ex violates)
- Protect yourself (legally, financially, emotionally)
- Focus on children (shield them from conflict, be the stable parent)
