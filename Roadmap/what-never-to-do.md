**Written by:** All 9 subagents (safety-crisis + legal-navigator + document-evidence + financial-forensics + coparenting + negotiation-settlement + court-compliance + tax-benefits + wellbeing-logistics)

This is your comprehensive "don't do this" list. Each mistake here can cost you custody, money, credibility, or your freedom. These aren't suggestions—these are bright-line rules based on what destroys cases.

---

## Safety & Crisis (safety-crisis agent)

### NEVER Do These—They're Dangerous or Illegal:

**Physical Retaliation:**
✗ NEVER physically retaliate against your spouse (no matter what they did)
✗ NEVER destroy their property in anger (smashing phone, keying car, breaking belongings)
✗ NEVER threaten violence ("I'll kill you," "You'll regret this," even if "just venting")
✗ NEVER use children as shields or leverage in confrontations

**Why:** Criminal charges (assault, vandalism, terroristic threats). Automatic loss of custody. Protective order against you. You're the one who ends up arrested, not them.

**Illegal Surveillance/Stalking:**
✗ NEVER install spyware on ex's phone/computer (federal crime: CFAA, wiretapping)
✗ NEVER follow/stalk ex (even to "see where they're going")
✗ NEVER install hidden cameras/GPS trackers in ex's car or home
✗ NEVER hack ex's email, social media, bank accounts (even if you know password)
✗ NEVER pay someone to surveil ex

**Why:** Criminal charges. Evidence inadmissible. You lose custody for violating law. Protective order. Destroyed credibility with judge.

**Self-Help "Justice":**
✗ NEVER take matters into your own hands (confronting ex's new partner, showing up at their work, "teaching them a lesson")
✗ NEVER publicize private information as revenge (posting nude photos, sharing secrets online)
✗ NEVER file false police reports to "get back at" ex

**Why:** Criminal charges (harassment, revenge porn, false reporting). Court sees you as vindictive, unstable. You lose.

**Ignoring Safety Red Flags:**
✗ NEVER stay in situation where you're being physically harmed (leaving is not "giving up"—it's survival)
✗ NEVER let children witness or experience violence (thinking "it's not that bad" or "it'll get better")
✗ NEVER fail to document abuse (photos of injuries, police reports, medical records) thinking "I'll just handle it myself"

**Why:** Safety is priority #1. Undocumented abuse = harder to prove later. Children exposed to violence = trauma, potential loss of custody to you for failing to protect them.

---

## Legal Process (legal-navigator agent)

### NEVER Do These—They Destroy Your Case:

**Missing Deadlines:**
✗ NEVER miss a court deadline (response to petition, financial disclosures, trial briefs)
✗ NEVER assume "a few days late is fine"—it's not
✗ NEVER ignore court orders thinking "I'll deal with it later"

**Why:** Default judgment (you lose automatically). Sanctions (fines, attorney fees). Court sees you as uncooperative. Orders enforced against you.

**Violating Court Orders:**
✗ NEVER disobey temporary orders (support, custody, ATROs)
✗ NEVER think "the order is unfair so I don't have to follow it"
✗ NEVER engage in "self-help" remedies (withholding support because ex denied parenting time, denying parenting time because ex didn't pay support)

**Why:** Contempt (fines, jail, attorney fees). Modification against you (if you violate custody, you lose custody). Criminal charges (if willful). Court trusts ex over you going forward.

**Lying to Court:**
✗ NEVER lie in declarations, testimony, or financial disclosures (income, assets, expenses, parenting history)
✗ NEVER exaggerate ("He's an alcoholic" when he has 2 beers/week)
✗ NEVER omit material information (hiding assets, failing to disclose income source)

**Why:** Perjury (crime). Destroyed credibility (judge assumes everything you say is lie). Sanctions. Loss of custody/property. Opposing counsel will catch you—they always do.

**Representing Yourself Badly:**
✗ NEVER go to court unprepared (no documents, no evidence, rambling testimony)
✗ NEVER argue with judge or interrupt
✗ NEVER make legal arguments based on Google (you're not a lawyer—statutes have nuances you don't understand)
✗ NEVER ignore attorney's advice because "you know better"

**Why:** You lose. Judges have no patience for unprepared, argumentative, or uninformed litigants. Attorney's advice is based on experience—ignore it at your peril.

**Ignoring Jurisdiction Rules:**
✗ NEVER file in wrong state/county (wastes time, money; case dismissed)
✗ NEVER assume "I can just move and file there" (UCCJEA has strict rules for custody jurisdiction)
✗ NEVER forum shop (filing in multiple states hoping for better result)

**Why:** Case dismissed. Sanctions. Wasted attorney fees. Delay (have to refile in correct jurisdiction).

---

## Evidence & Documentation (document-evidence agent)

### NEVER Do These—They're Illegal or Inadmissible:

**Illegal Evidence Gathering:**
✗ NEVER access ex's email/computer/phone without permission (federal crime: CFAA)
✗ NEVER record conversations you're not part of (illegal wiretapping)
✗ NEVER record in two-party consent states without all parties knowing (CA, FL, PA, IL, MA, MD, MI, MT, NH, CT, WA, NV)
✗ NEVER open ex's mail (federal crime)
✗ NEVER break into ex's home/car to take documents (trespassing, theft)

**Why:** Criminal charges. Evidence inadmissible (can't use it even if it proves your point). You lose custody (judge sees you as criminal). Sanctions.

**Destroying Evidence:**
✗ NEVER delete texts, emails, photos, documents (even if they make you look bad)
✗ NEVER destroy financial records (tax returns, bank statements, pay stubs)
✗ NEVER tell children to delete messages/photos
✗ NEVER factory reset phone/computer to "hide" evidence

**Why:** Spoliation sanctions (judge assumes destroyed evidence was harmful to you, rules against you). Obstruction. Contempt. You lose credibility completely.

**Fabricating Evidence:**
✗ NEVER create fake texts/emails (editing screenshots, fabricating messages)
✗ NEVER coach witnesses to lie
✗ NEVER submit forged documents (fake pay stubs, altered tax returns)
✗ NEVER stage photos (bruises with makeup, "messy house" photos you created)

**Why:** Perjury. Fraud. Criminal charges. Case dismissed. You lose custody. Sanctions. Disbarment for your attorney if they knew.

**Poor Documentation Practices:**
✗ NEVER rely on memory alone ("I'll remember what happened")
✗ NEVER fail to date/time-stamp notes
✗ NEVER keep "evidence" disorganized (random screenshots in phone, no folder system)
✗ NEVER assume "I don't need to write this down, it's obvious"

**Why:** Weak case. Can't prove your claims. Judge doesn't believe you ("If it was important, you would've documented it"). Ex's documented version becomes "truth."

**Oversharing:**
✗ NEVER post evidence on social media before trial ("Look what my ex did!")
✗ NEVER discuss case details publicly (alerts ex to your strategy)
✗ NEVER show evidence to too many people (risk of it getting back to ex, being leaked)

**Why:** Ex's attorney knows your strategy. Evidence potentially tainted. Privacy violations. You look vindictive/unstable.

---

## Financial Matters (financial-forensics agent)

### NEVER Do These—They're Fraud or Dissipation:

**Hiding Assets:**
✗ NEVER transfer assets to family/friends to hide them ("Give this to Mom, I'll get it back after divorce")
✗ NEVER open secret bank accounts
✗ NEVER purchase assets in someone else's name (new car in girlfriend's name, property in parent's name)
✗ NEVER fail to disclose assets on financial disclosures (retirement accounts, investments, crypto, business interests)

**Why:** Fraud. Breach of fiduciary duty. Sanctions (pay ex's attorney fees, reimburse community for hidden assets + penalty). Criminal charges (perjury). You lose credibility—judge awards more to ex.

**Dissipating Community Property:**
✗ NEVER gamble away community funds
✗ NEVER spend large amounts on new partner (trips, gifts, rent for their apartment)
✗ NEVER make luxury purchases for yourself only (new car, Rolex, boat)
✗ NEVER withdraw large cash amounts with no explanation
✗ NEVER pay family/friends "loans" that aren't real debts

**Why:** Breach of fiduciary duty. Court charges you for dissipated amounts (you owe ex half of what you wasted). Sanctions. You pay ex's attorney fees.

**ATRO Violations:**
✗ NEVER sell community property without consent or court order (house, car, investments, business)
✗ NEVER borrow against community property (HELOC, margin loan)
✗ NEVER cash out retirement accounts (early withdrawal penalties + violation)
✗ NEVER change beneficiaries on insurance/retirement accounts
✗ NEVER cancel insurance (health, life, auto, home)

**Why:** Contempt. Sanctions. Forced to restore asset (undo transaction). Pay ex's attorney fees. Criminal charges if willful.

**Income Hiding:**
✗ NEVER work "under the table" to avoid income being counted for support
✗ NEVER ask employer to defer bonus/income until after divorce
✗ NEVER claim lower income than you actually earn
✗ NEVER inflate business expenses to show less profit (if self-employed)

**Why:** Imputed income (court attributes higher income to you anyway). Sanctions. Fraud. Tax evasion charges (if you underreport to IRS too). Modification later (when real income discovered, you owe back support).

**Self-Help Financial Moves:**
✗ NEVER empty bank accounts (taking 100% instead of your 50% share)
✗ NEVER max out joint credit cards out of spite
✗ NEVER stop paying mortgage/bills to "force" ex to pay
✗ NEVER refuse to refinance or transfer assets per court order

**Why:** Contempt. Sanctions. Damaged credit (for you too—you're on the loan). Court orders you to pay it back. You lose in property division as penalty.

---

## Parenting & Custody (coparenting agent)

### NEVER Do These—They Cost You Custody:

**Parental Alienation:**
✗ NEVER badmouth ex to children ("Your dad doesn't love you," "Your mom is evil," "They abandoned us")
✗ NEVER interrogate children about ex's life ("Does Dad have a girlfriend?" "What does Mom do at her house?")
✗ NEVER use children as messengers ("Tell your dad he's a deadbeat," "Tell your mom she owes me money")
✗ NEVER force children to choose sides ("Do you want to live with me or Dad?")
✗ NEVER coach children ("Tell the judge you want to live with me," "Say Dad yells at you")
✗ NEVER reward child for rejecting other parent (extra gifts, privileges when child refuses to visit ex)

**Why:** Custody modification (you lose custody). Court-ordered therapy. Sanctions. Damaged parent-child relationships. Long-term psychological harm to children. You're seen as toxic, unstable parent.

**Violating Custody Orders:**
✗ NEVER withhold parenting time (deny ex's scheduled time, even if they didn't pay support)
✗ NEVER keep children past scheduled time
✗ NEVER take children during ex's time without permission (even for "good reason" like fun opportunity)
✗ NEVER move with children without required notice/permission
✗ NEVER cancel ex's time without legitimate reason (child actually sick, true emergency)

**Why:** Contempt (fines, jail, makeup time for ex). Modification (you lose custody if pattern of violations). Sanctions (pay ex's attorney fees). Criminal charges (custodial interference, kidnapping).

**Unilateral Decisions (If Joint Legal Custody):**
✗ NEVER change children's school without ex's agreement
✗ NEVER switch doctors without ex's agreement
✗ NEVER make major medical decisions without ex's agreement (surgery, medication changes) except true emergencies
✗ NEVER change children's religious upbringing without ex's agreement
✗ NEVER enroll children in expensive activities requiring ex's participation/payment without ex's agreement

**Why:** Violation of joint legal custody order. Contempt. Court reverses your decision. You lose legal custody (switched to sole legal custody to ex). Sanctions.

**Using Children as Pawns:**
✗ NEVER tell children about adult issues (court case, finances, ex's dating life, support amounts)
✗ NEVER make children feel guilty ("I can't afford food because your dad doesn't pay support")
✗ NEVER put children in middle ("Ask your mom if she'll agree to this")
✗ NEVER compete with ex for children's affection ("I'm the fun parent, your mom is mean")

**Why:** Emotional harm to children. Court sees you as damaging to children's wellbeing. Custody modification. Court-ordered therapy. Sanctions.

**Exposing Children to Harm:**
✗ NEVER introduce children to parade of romantic partners (new boyfriend/girlfriend every few months)
✗ NEVER allow new partner to discipline children
✗ NEVER leave children with unsafe caregivers (new partner with criminal history, substance abuser, no background check)
✗ NEVER expose children to substance use, domestic violence, criminal activity
✗ NEVER leave children unsupervised inappropriately (young children alone, older kids left overnight without adult)

**Why:** Modification (you lose custody). CPS involvement. Criminal charges (child endangerment). Children removed from your care. You're seen as unfit parent.

---

## Settlement & Negotiation (negotiation-settlement agent)

### NEVER Do These—They Kill Settlement:

**Bad Faith Negotiation:**
✗ NEVER make offers you have no intention of accepting (just to waste time)
✗ NEVER negotiate just to discover ex's positions, then refuse to compromise
✗ NEVER use mediation to delay trial when you have no intent to settle
✗ NEVER make extreme demands knowing they're unreasonable ("I want 100% custody, all assets, and $10K/month support")

**Why:** Sanctions (pay ex's attorney fees for wasting time). Mediation fails. Trial becomes inevitable (more expensive, unpredictable). Court sees you as unreasonable—rules against you.

**Unreasonable Positions:**
✗ NEVER demand more than BATNA (your best likely trial outcome) without justification
✗ NEVER reject offers within reasonable settlement range (between WATNA and BATNA) out of spite
✗ NEVER refuse to move from opening position (no compromise at all)
✗ NEVER anchor to irrelevant standards ("My friend got this in her divorce, so I should too")

**Why:** Settlement fails. Trial (expensive, risky). Court may sanction you for unreasonableness. You end up with worse outcome than offered settlement.

**Lying in Negotiation:**
✗ NEVER lie about finances ("I only earn $50K" when you earn $100K)
✗ NEVER hide assets during settlement talks (discovered during discovery—ruins trust)
✗ NEVER misrepresent your BATNA ("My attorney says I'll definitely get 70/30 custody" when that's not true)

**Why:** Settlement collapses when lie discovered. Sanctions. Criminal charges (fraud, perjury if in declarations). You lose all credibility—ex won't negotiate with you anymore.

**Emotional Negotiation:**
✗ NEVER negotiate from anger ("You cheated, so you get nothing!")
✗ NEVER make decisions to "win" or hurt ex (instead of based on your actual interests)
✗ NEVER reject good offers because "I don't want ex to think they won"
✗ NEVER use settlement discussions to relitigate the marriage ("You were a terrible spouse!")

**Why:** Bad decisions. You reject good offers out of spite, end up worse off at trial. Mediation fails. Attorney fees skyrocket. Years of litigation.

**Ignoring Objective Standards:**
✗ NEVER argue "I deserve this because I suffered more" (court doesn't care—uses guidelines, case law)
✗ NEVER demand outcomes that defy legal standards (50/50 custody when you've never been primary caregiver and work 80 hours/week)
✗ NEVER reject neutral evaluations/appraisals because "I don't like the number"

**Why:** Court uses objective standards anyway. You waste time and money fighting inevitable outcome. You lose credibility arguing for unrealistic result.

---

## Court Compliance (court-compliance agent)

### NEVER Do These—They're Contempt or Worse:

**Ignoring Court Orders:**
✗ NEVER disobey orders because "they're unfair" (feeling they're unjust doesn't excuse noncompliance)
✗ NEVER ignore temporary orders thinking "they're not final" (temporary orders are binding until modified or replaced)
✗ NEVER "wait and see" if ex enforces (they might not enforce for months, then file contempt for entire period)

**Why:** Contempt (fines, jail, attorney fees). Modification against you. Court assumes you'll violate future orders—rules against you.

**Missing Deadlines:**
✗ NEVER miss filing deadlines (responses, financial disclosures, trial briefs)
✗ NEVER assume "a few days late is fine"—it's not
✗ NEVER ignore deadline reminders from attorney or court

**Why:** Default judgment (automatic loss). Sanctions (fines, attorney fees). Evidence excluded (if you miss deadline to submit evidence). Case dismissed (if you're petitioner and miss deadlines).

**Non-Payment of Support:**
✗ NEVER stop paying support without court order (even if you lost job, were laid off, or ex isn't following custody order)
✗ NEVER reduce support amount on your own ("She got a job, so I'm paying less")
✗ NEVER pay in cash without receipt (can't prove you paid)
✗ NEVER pay late (accumulates arrears + interest)

**Why:** Contempt. Wage garnishment. License suspension (driver's, professional). Tax refund interception. Jail (if willful non-payment). Arrears accumulate (with 10% interest in most states)—can't be discharged in bankruptcy.

**Failure to Transfer Assets:**
✗ NEVER delay transferring assets per judgment (deed to house, vehicle title, QDRO)
✗ NEVER refuse to refinance when ordered (thinking "I'll just wait them out")
✗ NEVER "forget" to update beneficiaries, insurance per order

**Why:** Contempt. Specific performance (court forces you to comply). Sanctions. Attorney fees. Daily fines until compliance.

**Violating Restraining Orders:**
✗ NEVER contact ex if there's restraining order/protective order (no texts, emails, calls, showing up at their work/home)
✗ NEVER use third parties to contact ex on your behalf (having friend deliver message)
✗ NEVER assume "if they contact me first, I can respond"—you still can't respond

**Why:** Criminal charges (violation of protective order). Jail. Extended protective order. Lose custody. Destroyed credibility.

**Self-Help Enforcement:**
✗ NEVER take enforcement into your own hands (withholding support because ex denied parenting time, denying parenting time because ex didn't pay support)
✗ NEVER seize ex's property to satisfy judgment (taking their car because they owe you money)
✗ NEVER garnish wages/accounts without court order

**Why:** Contempt (you violated orders). Potential criminal charges (theft, harassment). Court rules against you. File proper enforcement motions instead.

---

## Taxes (tax-benefits agent)

### NEVER Do These—They're Tax Fraud or Penalties:

**Filing Errors:**
✗ NEVER file joint return without ex's consent (after separation or pending divorce)
✗ NEVER file as "Single" when you're still legally married on Dec 31 (file MFS or HOH if qualify)
✗ NEVER claim children when you don't have right (per custody order or IRS rules)
✗ NEVER fail to report alimony received (pre-2019 divorces—it's taxable income)

**Why:** IRS penalties. Interest. Amended returns (additional accountant fees). IRS keeps your refund. Potential audit. Criminal charges if intentional fraud.

**Ignoring Tax Consequences:**
✗ NEVER agree to property division without considering after-tax values (401k ≠ cash)
✗ NEVER take retirement distribution without QDRO (triggers taxes + 10% early withdrawal penalty)
✗ NEVER transfer IRA without direct trustee-to-trustee transfer (triggers taxes if done wrong)
✗ NEVER sell home without considering capital gains (lose $250K exclusion if not primary residence 2 of last 5 years)

**Why:** Unexpected tax bills (thousands to tens of thousands). Penalties. Reduced value of asset (you thought you got $100K but after taxes it's $75K).

**Dependency Exemption Violations:**
✗ NEVER both claim the same child (IRS rejects both returns until resolved)
✗ NEVER claim child when ex has court order allowing them to claim
✗ NEVER fail to provide Form 8332 when required (if you're custodial parent releasing exemption to ex)

**Why:** IRS rejects return. Delayed refund. Penalties. Contempt (if violating court order). Wasted time resolving with IRS.

**Alimony Structuring Errors:**
✗ NEVER treat property division as alimony (it's not deductible)
✗ NEVER call child support "alimony" to make it deductible (IRS sees through this)
✗ NEVER agree to alimony terms that don't meet IRS requirements (must be cash payments, must terminate on death)

**Why:** IRS disallows deduction. Payor owes back taxes + penalties. Recipient potentially double-taxed. Audit.

**Hiding Income:**
✗ NEVER fail to report cash income to avoid support calculation or taxes
✗ NEVER inflate business expenses to reduce taxable income (if self-employed)
✗ NEVER claim false deductions

**Why:** IRS audit. Tax fraud charges. Criminal prosecution. Prison (if large amounts). Court imputes income anyway (support based on earning capacity, not what you report).

---

## Wellbeing & Logistics (wellbeing-logistics agent)

### NEVER Do These—They Harm Your Recovery:

**Isolation:**
✗ NEVER cut yourself off from friends and family (thinking "I'm a burden" or "I'll handle this alone")
✗ NEVER refuse help when offered
✗ NEVER stop social activities completely

**Why:** Depression worsens. No support system when you need it. Worse decision-making (no one to reality-check you). Physical health declines. You become overwhelmed, can't function.

**Substance Abuse:**
✗ NEVER use alcohol or drugs to cope with stress
✗ NEVER "self-medicate" instead of seeing therapist or doctor
✗ NEVER drive under influence (even "just to clear your head")

**Why:** Addiction. Loss of custody (substance abuse = unfit parent). DUI (criminal record, loss of license, job). Worse mental health. Impaired judgment (bad legal decisions). CPS involvement. Children removed from your care.

**Neglecting Mental Health:**
✗ NEVER ignore signs of depression, anxiety, PTSD (thinking "I should be able to handle this")
✗ NEVER skip therapy because "I don't have time" or "I can't afford it"
✗ NEVER stop taking prescribed medication without doctor's supervision
✗ NEVER dismiss suicidal thoughts as "just venting"

**Why:** Mental health deteriorates. Worse legal outcomes (can't think clearly, make bad decisions). Physical health declines. Relationship with children suffers. In crisis: Suicide risk (divorce is high-risk period). If you're having suicidal thoughts, call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) immediately.

**Neglecting Physical Health:**
✗ NEVER skip medical appointments (thinking "I'll go when divorce is over")
✗ NEVER ignore symptoms (chest pain, persistent headaches, drastic weight loss/gain)
✗ NEVER sacrifice sleep to work on case (chronic sleep deprivation impairs judgment)

**Why:** Serious illness worsens. Emergency medical situations. Cognitive impairment (bad decisions). Can't function at work, as parent. Increased stress/anxiety.

**Financial Denial:**
✗ NEVER ignore mounting debt (thinking "I'll deal with it later")
✗ NEVER avoid creating post-divorce budget (unrealistic about what you can afford)
✗ NEVER make major financial decisions impulsively (buying new house, quitting job, starting business)

**Why:** Bankruptcy. Foreclosure. Eviction. Can't pay attorney fees (case suffers). Can't comply with support orders (contempt). Bad decisions (commit to unaffordable housing, can't sustain).

**Using Children for Support:**
✗ NEVER lean on children emotionally ("You're the only one who understands me")
✗ NEVER confide adult problems to children (finances, legal issues, dating)
✗ NEVER expect children to take sides or provide comfort

**Why:** Parentification (role reversal—child becomes parent's caretaker). Psychological harm to children. Damaged parent-child relationship. Children feel responsible for your wellbeing (inappropriate burden). Custody evaluator sees this—you lose custody.

**Avoiding Reality:**
✗ NEVER pretend divorce isn't happening (ignoring paperwork, missing deadlines, hoping "it'll go away")
✗ NEVER make decisions based on wishful thinking ("Ex will change their mind," "Judge will see I'm right and give me everything")
✗ NEVER assume "it'll all work out" without taking action

**Why:** Default judgment (you lose). Missed opportunities (settlement offers expire). Worse outcomes (unprepared for trial, no strategy). Financial disaster (didn't plan for post-divorce expenses). Regret (could have protected yourself but didn't).

---

## Summary: The Absolute Never List

**Never:**
1. Commit crimes (assault, stalking, hacking, destroying evidence, perjury, fraud, tax evasion, custodial interference)
2. Violate court orders (custody, support, ATROs, protective orders, deadlines)
3. Lie to court, attorneys, or in financial disclosures
4. Hide, dissipate, or destroy community assets or evidence
5. Use children as pawns, messengers, or confidants
6. Alienate children from other parent (badmouthing, coaching, blocking contact)
7. Retaliate or engage in "self-help" remedies (withholding support, denying parenting time, emptying accounts)
8. Negotiate in bad faith or reject reasonable settlement offers out of spite
9. Ignore your mental health, physical health, or wellbeing
10. Isolate yourself or turn to substances to cope

**If you do any of these:**
- You lose credibility with court
- You face contempt, sanctions, criminal charges
- You damage or lose custody of children
- You pay more in attorney fees and court costs
- You get worse outcome than you would have otherwise
- You harm yourself and your children long-term

**Golden Rule:** When in doubt, ask your attorney first. Violating these rules harms your case far more than any temporary satisfaction or perceived advantage.
